\section{Review and Reporting}
%\cmt{Lead Editor}{Graham Giovanetti}

%Project reporting will occur as called out by each of the partnering funding agencies, and will include notifications for specific events and periodic reports on progress and project technical and financial status.  The necessary reviews, audits, and assessments of the project and its progress are well understood and will be detailed in the full PEP.

The Technical Coordinators will lead quarterly reviews on technical progress, cost, schedule, and safety and report the results to the NSF Program Officer and the appropriate partnering funding agencies. The TCs will monitor technical performance throughout the design and construction stage. Internal design reviews and performance testing will ensure that the detector subsystems meet the requirements of the project.

The reporting requirements include the preparation of regular quarterly reports as well as other reports as appropriate. The following reports will be required:
\begin{itemize}
\item Status and performance reports (quarterly), which will cover technical progress, cost, schedule, and safety;
\item Technical Board meeting notes (weekly) summarizing progress;
\item Variance reports (as needed);
\item Change requests (as needed); and
\item Annual reports.
\end{itemize}
