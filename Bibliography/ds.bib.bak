abstract = {An evaluation of the principal uncertainties in the computation of neutrino fluxes produced in cosmic ray showers in the atmosphere is presented. The neutrino flux predictions are needed for comparison with experiment to perform neutrino oscillation studies. The paper concentrates on the main limitations which are due to hadron production uncertainties. It also treats primary cosmic ray flux uncertainties, which are at a lower level. The absolute neutrino fluxes are found to have errors of around 15% in the neutrino energy region important for contained events underground. Large cancellations of these errors occur when ratios of fluxes are considered, in particular, the ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\mu}}/{\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{\ensuremath{\mu}}$ ratio below ${E}_{\ensuremath{\nu}}=1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$, the $({\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\mu}}+{\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{\ensuremath{\mu}})/({\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e}+{\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{e})$ ratio below ${E}_{\ensuremath{\nu}}=10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$ and the up/down ratios above ${E}_{\ensuremath{\nu}}=1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$ are at the 1% level. A detailed breakdown of the origin of these errors and cancellations is presented.},

abstract = {Direct detection strategies are proposed for dark matter particles with MeV to GeV mass. In this largely unexplored mass range, dark matter scattering with electrons can cause single-electron ionization signals, which are detectable with current technology. Ultraviolet photons, individual ions, and heat are interesting alternative signals. Focusing on ionization, we calculate the expected dark matter scattering rates and estimate the sensitivity of possible experiments. Backgrounds that may be relevant are discussed. Theoretically interesting models may be within reach using existing data and ongoing direct detection experiments. Significant improvements in sensitivity should be possible with dedicated experiments, opening up a window to new regions in dark matter parameter space.},

We observe no signal in a 1.83 kgyr 82Se exposure and we set the most stringent lower limit on the  82Se half-life T0$\nu$1/2> 2.4 1024 yr (90% C.I.), which corresponds to an effective Majorana neutrino mass m$\beta$$\beta$ < (376-770) meV depending on the nuclear matrix element calculations. The heat-light readout provides a powerful tool for the rejection of \ particles and allows to suppress the background in the region of interest down to (3.6+1.9-1.4)10-3, an unprecedented level for this technique.},

abstract = {The axion is a promising dark matter candidate, which was originally proposed to solve the strong-CP problem in particle physics. To date, the available parameter space for axion and axion-like particle dark matter is relatively unexplored, particularly at masses ma1\,$\mu$eV. ABRACADABRA is a new experimental program to search for axion dark matter over a broad range of masses, 10-12 ma10-6 eV. ABRACADABRA-10 cm is a small-scale prototype for a future detector that could be sensitive to the QCD axion. In this Letter, we present the first results from a 1 month search for axions with ABRACADABRA-10 cm. We find no evidence for axion-like cosmic dark matter and set 95% C.L. upper limits on the axion-photon coupling between ga$\gamma$$\gamma$<1.410-10 GeV-1 and ga$\gamma$$\gamma$<3.310-9 GeV-1 over the mass range 3.110-10 eV - 8.310-9 eV. These results are competitive with the most stringent astrophysical constraints in this mass range.},

abstract = {A theoretical investigation of factors limiting the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of active matrix flat-panel imagers (AMFPIs), and of methods to overcome these limitations, is reported. At the higher exposure levels associated with radiography, the present generation of AMFPIs is capable of exhibiting DQE performance equivalent, or superior, to that of existing film-screen and computed radiography systems. However, at exposure levels commonly encountered in fluoroscopy, AMFPIs exhibit significantly reduced DQE and this problem is accentuated at higher spatial frequencies. The problem applies both to AMFPIs that rely on indirect detection as well as direct detection of the incident radiation. This reduced performance derives from the relatively large magnitude of the square of the total additive noise compared to the system gain for existing AMFPIs. In order to circumvent these restrictions, a variety of strategies to decrease additive noise and enhance system gain are proposed. Additive noise could be reduced through improved preamplifier, pixel and array design, including the incorporation of compensation lines to sample external line noise. System gain could be enhanced through the use of continuous photodiodes, pixel amplifiers, or higher gain x-ray converters such as lead iodide. The feasibility of these and other strategies is discussed and potential improvements to DQE performance are quantified through a theoretical investigation of a variety of hypothetical 200 $\mu$m pitch designs. At low exposures, such improvements could greatly increase the magnitude of the low spatial frequency component of the DQE, rendering it practically independent of exposure while simultaneously reducing the falloff in DQE at higher spatial frequencies. Furthermore, such noise reduction and gain enhancement could lead to the development of AMFPIs with high DQE performance which are capable of providing both high resolution radiographicimages, at ∼100 $\mu$m pixel resolution, as well as variable resolution fluoroscopic images at 30 fps.},

abstract = {The world is experiencing a shortage of helium-3, a rare isotope of helium with applications in homeland security, national security, medicine, industry, and science.  For many years the supply of helium-3 from the nuclear weapons program outstripped the demand for helium-3.  The demand was small enough that a substantial stockpile of helium-3 accumulated.  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the federal government began deploying neutron detectors at the U.S. border to help secure the nation against smuggled nuclear and radiological material.  The deployment of this equipment created new demand for helium-3.  Use of the polarized helium-3 medical imaging technique also increased.  As a result, the size of the stockpile shrank.  After several years of demand exceeding supply, a call for large quantities of helium-3 spurred federal officials to realize that insufficient helium-3 was available to meet the likely future demand.  Policymakers now face a number of challenging decisions. In the short term, these decisions are mainly about how to allocate a scarce resource in the face of competing priorities: science versus security, the private sector versus the public sector, and national needs versus international obligations.  Applications with unique needs may pose particular challenges.  For example, some types of cryogenic research can only be accomplished using helium-3, whereas in medical imaging and neutron detection, helium 3 has advantages but also alternatives.  In the longer term, policymakers also face choices about how or whether to increase helium-3 supply or reduce helium-3 demand and about possible alternative mechanisms for allocating supply.  It seems likely that a combination of policy approaches will be necessary.  In addition to the nuclear weapons program, potential sources of helium-3 include tritium produced as a byproduct in commercial heavy-water nuclear reactors; extraction of naturally occurring helium-3 from natural gas or the atmosphere; and production of either tritium or helium-3 using particle accelerators.  Until recently, the ready supply of helium-3 from the nuclear weapons program meant that these alternative sources were not considered economic.  With the current shortage, this perception may change.  The federal response to the helium-3 shortage began only after the shortage had occurred.  Policy was established first by an ad-hoc interagency group formed by the Departments of Energy (DOE), Homeland Security (DHS), and Defense (DOD), and then by an interagency committee established by the National Security Staff.  The committee developed a rationing scheme for allocating the available helium-3. Some federal and private-sector users received no allocation or an amount less than they had planned.  Several federal agencies are investigating alternative sources of helium-3 and ways to reduce the demand.  Congress is just beginning to grapple with the helium-3 problem. In April 2010, Congress held its first hearing whose main subject was helium-3.  So far, congressional attention appears to be focused on oversight of the current situation, how it arose, and the processes currently in place for addressing it.  In future hearings and legislation, Congress may address additional issues, such as increasing the helium-3 supply, reducing demand, or changing how supply is allocated.  This report discusses the nature of the shortage; federal actions undertaken so far to address it; current and potential sources of helium-3 and options for increasing the supply; current and projected uses of helium-3 and options for reducing the demand; and options for allocating the supply if it continues to fall short of the demand.},

abstract = {Sulfur and selenium isotopes are used for labeled compunds and as precursors for radioisotope production; however, both limited availability and high costs are problems.  A new method is needed for large scale separation of these isotopes.  Experimental distillation columns were used to measure isotopic separation for sulfur and selenium compounds.  The maximum total isotope separation of 32S vs. 34S were 1.127 for H2S, 1.048 for COS, 0.838 for SF4, and 1.058 for CH3SH.  Relative volatilities of 32S vs. 34S are 1.0006 for COS and 0.9976 for SF4.  There is a reverse isotope effect for carbon in COS.  No isotopic separation was observed for dimethyl selenide.  The lower mass selenium isotopes in H2Se are more volatile.  Distillation is a promising method for separating sulfur isotopes on a production scale.  Existing distillation technology produces separated isotopes with an effect similar to that found forsulfur in SF4.},

The PandaX-I detector has been optimized for detecting low-mass WIMPs, achieving a photon detection efficiency of 9.6%. With a fiducial liquid xenon target mass of 54.0 kg, no significant excess events were found above the expected background. A profile likelihood ratio analysis confirms our earlier finding that the PandaX-I data disfavor all positive low-mass WIMP signals reported in the literature under standard assumptions. A stringent bound on a low-mass WIMP is set at a WIMP mass below $10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$, demonstrating that liquid xenon detectors can be competitive for low-mass WIMP searches.},

abstract = {We report on the first large-scale production of low radioactivity argon from underground gas wells. Low radioactivity argon is of general interest, in particular for the construction of large scale WIMP dark matter searches and detectors of reactor neutrinos for non-proliferation efforts. Atmospheric argon has an activity of about 1 Bq/kg from the decays of 39Ar; the concentration of 39Ar in the underground argon we are collecting is at least a factor of 100 lower than this value. The argon is collected from a stream of gas from a CO2 well in southwestern Colorado with a Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption (VPSA) plant. The gas from the well contains argon at a concentration of 400-600 ppm, and the VPSA plant produces an output stream with an argon concentration at the level of 30,000-50,000 ppm (3-5%) in a single pass. This gas is sent for further processing to Fermilab where it is purified by cryogenic distillation. The argon production rate is presently 0.5 kg/day.},

Based on state-of-the-art microscopic simulations, a substantial addition of Helium, around 10 or 15 %, may reduce drastically the transverse diffusion down to 3 mm/{m} from the 10.5 mm/{m} of pure xenon. The longitudinal diffusion remains around 4.5 mm/{m}. At the same time, studies of light production can easily be done showing that the energy resolution is practically unaffected by such change. In this paper also we address the technical caveats of using photomultipliers close to a helium atmosphere.},

The most promising method in the near future is complete energy-momentum reconstruction of individual beta-decay or K-capture events, using atoms suspended in a magneto-optical trap. A survey of suitable isotopes is presented, together with the measurement precision required in a typical experimental configuration. It is concluded that among the most promising are the K-capture isotopes 131Cs, which requires measurement of an X-ray and several Auger electrons in addition to the atomic recoil, and 7Be which has only a single decay product but needs development work to achieve a trapped source. A number of background effects are discussed. It is concluded that sterile neutrinos with masses down to the 5-10 keV region would be detectable, together with relative couplings down to the level 10-10-10-11 in a 1-2 year running time.},

abstract = {A core-collapse supernova will produce an enormous burst of neutrinos of all flavors in the few-tens-of-MeV range. Measurement of the flavor, time, and energy structure of a nearby core-collapse neutrino burst will yield answers to many physics and astrophysics questions. The neutrinos left over from past cosmic supernovae are also observable, and their detection will improve knowledge of core-collapse rates and average neutrino emission. This review describes experimental techniques for detection of core-collapse neutrinos, as well as the sensitivities of current and future detectors.},

abstract = {We present a detailed description of the electromagnetic filter for the PTOLEMY project to directly detect the Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB). Starting with an initial estimate for the orbital magnetic moment, the higher-order drift process of ExB is configured to balance the gradient-B drift motion of the electron in such a way as to guide the trajectory into the standing voltage potential along the mid-plane of the filter. As a function of drift distance along the length of the filter, the filter zooms in with exponentially increasing precision on the transverse velocity component of the electron kinetic energy. This yields a linear dimension for the total filter length that is exceptionally compact compared to previous techniques for electromagnetic filtering. The parallel velocity component of the electron kinetic energy oscillates in an electrostatic harmonic trap as the electron drifts along the length of the filter. An analysis of the phase-space volume conservation validates the expected behavior of the filter from the adiabatic invariance of the orbital magnetic moment and energy conservation following Liouville's theorem for Hamiltonian systems.},

Taking Super-Kamiokande as a working example, dramatic consequences for reactor neutrino measurements, first observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background, galactic supernova detection, and other topics are discussed.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Results from a new PET/CT scanner using lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystals for the PET component are presented. This scanner, which operates in a fully 3-dimensional mode, has a diameter of 90 cm and an axial field of view of 18 cm. It uses 4 x 4 x 22 mm(3) LYSO crystals arranged in a pixelated Anger-logic detector design. This scanner was designed to perform as a high-performance conventional PET scanner as well as provide good timing resolution to operate as a time-of-flight (TOF) PET scanner. METHODS: Performance measurements on the scanner were made using the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU2-2001 procedures to benchmark its conventional imaging capabilities. The scatter fraction and noise equivalent count (NEC) measurements with the NEMA cylinder (20-cm diameter) were repeated for 2 larger cylinders (27-cm and 35-cm diameter), which better represent average and heavy patients. New measurements were designed to characterize its intrinsic timing resolution capability, which defines its TOF performance. Additional measurements to study the impact of pulse pileup at high counting rates on timing, as well as energy and spatial, resolution were also performed. Finally, to characterize the effect of TOF reconstruction on lesion contrast and noise, the standard NEMA/International Electrotechnical Commission torso phantom as well as a large 35-cm-diameter phantom with both hot and cold spheres were imaged for varying scan times. RESULTS: The transverse and axial resolution near the center is 4.8 mm. The absolute sensitivity of this scanner measured with a 70-cm-long line source is 6.6 cps/kBq, whereas scatter fraction is 27% measured with a 70-cm-long line source in a 20-cm-diameter cylinder. For the same line source cylinder, the peak NEC rate is measured to be 125 kcps at an activity concentration of 17.4 kBq/mL (0.47 microCi/mL). The 2 larger cylinders showed a decrease in the peak NEC due to increased attenuation, scatter, and random coincidences, and the peak occurs at lower activity concentrations. The system coincidence timing resolution was measured to be 585 ps. The timing resolution changes as a function of the singles rate due to pulse pileup and could impact TOF image reconstruction. Image-quality measurements with the torso phantom show that very high quality images can be obtained with short scan times (1-2 min per bed position). However, the benefit of TOF is more apparent with the large 35-cm-diameter phantom, where small spheres are detectable only with TOF information for short scan times. CONCLUSION: The Gemini TF whole-body scanner represents the first commercially available fully 3-dimensional PET scanner that achieves TOF capability as well as conventional imaging capabilities. The timing resolution is also stable over a long duration, indicating the practicality of this device. Excellent image quality is achieved for whole-body studies in 10-30 min, depending on patient size. The most significant improvement with TOF is seen for the heaviest patients.},

Here we describe an improved circuit configuration where, by attributing the functions of low noise and high dynamic range to two different transistors, the linearity can be improved and the noise can be decreased while reducing the power dissipation by a factor of three (to about 50 mW). The gain (i.e., the transresistance) and the input impedance can be chosen independently without changing the power supply voltages and power dissipation},

Formulas are derived here to estimate the statistical fluctuations of the number of ions produced by constant amounts of radiation energy. The variance of the number of ionizations is found to be two or three times smaller than if this number were governed by a Poisson distribution. An improved understanding is gained of the statistical treatment of fluctuation phenomena.},

The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $35.9{\textasciitilde}\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a $\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ system that has a large Lorentz boost. The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction. Results are interpreted in terms of limits on parameters in the Baryonic Z' and 2HDM+a simplified models. For these models, the presented results constitute either the most stringent constraints or the first constraints obtained so far.},

abstract = {Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. As advancing age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD, the number of those afflicted is expected to increase markedly with the aging of the world{\textquoteright}s population. The inability to definitively diagnose AD until autopsy remains an impediment to establishing effective targeted treatments. Neuroimaging has enabled in vivo visualisation of pathological changes in the brain associated with the disease, providing a greater understanding of its pathophysiological development and progression. However, neuroimaging biomarkers do not yet offer clear advantages over current clinical diagnostic criteria for them to be accepted into routine clinical use. Nonetheless, current insights from neuroimaging combined with the elucidation of biochemical and molecular processes in AD are informing the ongoing development of new imaging techniques and their application. Much of this research has been greatly assisted by the availability of transgenic mouse models of AD. In this review we summarise the main efforts of neuroimaging in AD in humans and in mouse models, with a specific focus on $\beta$-amyloid, and discuss the potential of new applications and novel approaches.},

abstract = {Avalanche photodiodes biased above the breakdown voltage are an interesting alternative to photomultiplier tubes in time-correlated single-photon counting. The characteristics and performance of a commercially available device (RCA C30921S) have been investigated. The time resolution is found to improve as the excess bias above the breakdown voltage is increased. Full width at half-maximum values down to 400 ps have been measured with the detector cooled at {\textminus}40 {\textdegree}C, and down to 460 ps at room temperature. The best results were obtained with an active quenching circuit, suitable for operation with excess bias voltage up to 40 V; at room temperature, fast gated operation was used for attaining optimum performance. Experimental data on the statistical behavior of the avalanche current pulses in these devices are reported and discussed.},

abstract = {DarkSide is a direct dark matter detection experiment searching for evidence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a well-motivated candidate for dark matter. The DarkSide-50 Time Projection Chamber (TPC) has an active volume containing 50 kg of liquid argon and has been in operation at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy since late 2013. The DarkSide-50 TPC is surrounded by a 30 t boron-loaded liquid scintillator that acts as a Neutron Veto (NV). The NV is immersed in a 1 kt ultra-pure water Cherenkov detector that acts as a Muon Veto (MV) and passive shielding against external neutrons and $\gamma$-rays. 								 WIMP interactions are expected to be rare due to the low scattering cross section. A majority of the signals in our detector are from background particles. There are four primary sources of background: $\gamma$-rays and Cherenkov radiation from radioactive decays in the detector's construction materials, $\beta${\textquoteright}s from (_^85)Kr and (_^39)Ar dissolved in the argon target, and neutrons from ($\alpha$, n) and fission reactions from radioactive contaminants in the detector's materials. 								 The DarkSide-50 TPC is designed to efficiently reduce background from $\beta${\textquoteright}s and $\gamma$-rays as well as from Cherenkov radiation by applying pulse shape discrimination and fiducial volume cuts. In this report, I will present detailed estimates of $\gamma$-ray activities of the detector components based on spectra and rates measured with the TPC and the NV. 								 The most important background in WIMP direct detection experiments are neutrons, which can produce elastic nuclear recoils that look exactly like WIMP interactions. In DarkSide-50, we both actively suppress and measure the rate of neutron-induced background events using the NV. The NV response was calibrated using two radioactive neutron sources, (_^241)Am (_^13)C and (_^241)Am (_^9)Be. I will present the neutron veto efficiency based on this calibration data.},

abstract = {Ample evidence has been gathered demonstrating that the majority of the mass in the universe is composed of non-luminous, non-baryonic matter. Though the evidence for dark matter is unassailable, its nature and properties remain unknown. A broad effort has been undertaken by the physics community to detect dark-matter particles through direct-detection techniques. For over a decade, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has observed a highly significant (9.3$\sigma$) modulation in the scintillation event rate in their highly pure NaI(Tl) detectors, which they use as the basis of a claim for the discovery of dark-matter particles. 								 However, the dark-matter interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA modulation remains unverified. While there have been some recent hints of dark matter in the form of a light Weakly-Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) from the CoGeNT and CDMS-Si experiments, when assuming a WIMP dark-matter model, several other experiments, including the LUX and XENON noble-liquid experiments, the KIMS CsI(Tl) experiment, and several bubble chamber experiments, conflict with DAMA/LIBRA. However, these experiments use different dark-matter targets and cannot be compared with DAMA/LIBRA in a model-independent way. The uncertainty surrounding the dark-matter model, astrophysical model, and nuclear-physics effects makes it necessary for a new NaI(Tl) experiment to directly test the DAMA/LIBRA result. 								 The Sodium-iodide with Active Background REjection (SABRE) experiment seeks to provide a much-needed model-independent test of the DAMA/LIBRA modulation by developing highly pure crystal detectors with very low radioactivity and deploying them in an active veto detector that can reject key backgrounds in a dark-matter measurement. This work focuses on the efforts put forward by the SABRE collaboration in developing low-background, low-threshold crystal detectors, designing and fabricating a liquid-scintillator veto detector, and simulating the predicted background spectrum for a dark-matter measurement. In addition, recent controversy surrounding the value of an important parameter for direct detection{\textemdash}the nuclear quenching factor{\textemdash}prompted SABRE to perform a measurement of the quenching factor in sodium. The measurement, its results, and the implications for DAMA/LIBRA and dark matter are also described.},

abstract = {Commercially available capacitors are not specified for operation at 77 K or 4 K, and some devices showed a dramatic decrease of capacitance at cryogenic temperature. Furthermore, for voltage biasing of cryogenic low impedance sensors it is very important to know parasitic resistance. In this case, the parasitic Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) of the capacitor used for the AC-biasing is a bottleneck of the voltage biasing. Involved in TES development and SQUID multiplexing, we have characterized the capacitance and the ESR values of some commercially available capacitors at 77 K and 4 K.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVES:Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycaemia. Several natural products have been isolated and identified to restore the complications of diabetes. Spirulina maxima is naturally occurring fresh water cyanobacterium, enriched with proteins and essential nutrients. The aim of the study was to determine whether S. maxima could serve as a therapeutic agent to correct metabolic abnormalities induced by excessive fructose administration in Wistar rats.

METHODS:Oral administration of 10 per cent fructose solution to Wistar rats (n = 5 in each group) for 30 days resulted in hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Aqueous suspension of S. maxima (5 or 10%) was also administered orally once daily for 30 days. The therapeutic potential of the preparation with reference to metformin (500 mg/kg) was assessed by monitoring various biochemical parameters at 10 day intervals during the course of therapy and at the end of 30 days S. maxima administration.

RESULTS:Significant (P<0.001) reductions in blood glucose, lipid profile (triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL, VLDL) and liver function markers (SGPT and SGOT) were recorded along with elevated level of HDL-C at the end of 30 days therapy of 5 or 10 per cent S. maxima aquous extract. Co-administration of S. maxima extract (5 or 10% aqueous) with 10 per cent fructose solution offered a significant protection against fructose induced metabolic abnormalities in Wistar rats.

INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSIONS:The present findings showed that S. maxima exhibited anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-hyperlipidaemic and hepatoprotective activity in rats fed with fructose. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms.},

abstract = {In recent years it has become apparent that the oxidation of lipids, or lipid peroxidation, is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of several disease states in adult and infant patients. Lipid peroxidation is a process generated naturally in small amounts in the body, mainly by the effect of several reactive oxygen species (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide etc.). It can also be generated by the action of several phagocytes. These reactive oxygen species readily attack the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the fatty acid membrane, initiating a self-propagating chain reaction. The destruction of membrane lipids and the end-products of such lipid peroxidation reactions are especially dangerous for the viability of cells, even tissues. Enzymatic (catalase, superoxide dismutasse) and nonenzymatic (vitamins A and E) natural antioxidant defence mechanisms exist; however, these mechanisms may be overcome, causing lipid peroxidation to take place. Since lipid peroxidation is a self-propagating chain-reaction, the initial oxidation of only a few lipid molecules can result in significant tissue damage. Despite extensive research in the field of lipid peroxidation it has not yet been precisely determined if it is the cause or an effect of several pathological conditions. Lipid peroxidation has been implicated in disease states such as atherosclerosis, IBD, ROP, BPD, asthma, Parkinson's disease, kidney damage, preeclampsia and others.},

abstract = {Culture collapse due to high temperatures can significantly impact the profitability of outdoor algal cultivation systems. The objective of this study was to model for the first time the impact of high temperatures on algal activity and viability. Viability measurements on Dunaliella salina cultures were based on cytometry with two fluorescent markers (erythrosine and fluorescein di-acetate), and photosynthetic activity was measured by Pulse Amplitude Modulation{\&}nbsp;(PAM) fluorometry. Kinetic studies revealed that viability and activity losses during exposure to high temperatures could be described by a Weibull model. Both mortality and activity were shown to be functions of the thermal dose received by the algae, defined as the product of duration of exposure to high temperatures and an exponential function of temperature. Simulations at five climatic locations revealed that culture collapse due to high temperatures could impact productivity of D. salina in non-temperature-controlled outdoor photobioreactors by 35 and 40% in arid and Mediterranean climates, respectively. The model developed in this study can be used to forecast the impact of high temperatures on algal biofuel productivity. When coupled with models predicting the temperature of outdoor cultivation systems, this model can also be used to select the best combination of location, system geometry, and algal species to minimize the risks of culture collapse and therefore maximize biofuel productivity.},

New results obtained with these methods on a number of differently charged materials are surveyed, together with data for charge transport and charge decay. Of particular significance is the charge storage capability of silicon dioxide/silicon nitride double layers which was discovered only very recently.

We directed picosecond pulses of GeV bremsstrahlung photons at the SLAC Final Focus Test Beam into a 3.5 ton silica sand target, producing electromagnetic showers several meters long. A series of antennas spanning 0.3 to 6 GHz detected strong, subnanosecond radio-frequency pulses produced by the showers. Measurements of the polarization, coherence, timing, field strength vs shower depth, and field strength vs frequency are completely consistent with predictions. These measurements thus provide strong support for experiments designed to detect high-energy cosmic rays such as neutrinos via coherent radio emission from their cascades.},

We employ a new type of germanium detector to conclusively rule out a standard isothermal galactic halo of weakly interacting massive particles as the explanation for the annual modulation effect leading to the claim. Bounds are similarly imposed on a suggestion that dark pseudoscalars might lead to the effect. We describe the sensitivity to light dark matter particles achievable with our device, in particular, to next-to-minimal supersymmetric model candidates.},

We present a simple circuit implementation of the new transimpedance amplifier, together with the results of its noise characterization. The comparison between these measurements and those obtained on a conventional transimpedance amplifier with the same transimpedance gain has confirmed that the proposed approach allows us to obtain a lower background noise and a larger BW for the same transimpedance gain.},

abstract = {The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) could be revolutionary for MeV neutrino astrophysics, due to its huge detector volume, unique event reconstruction capabilities, and excellent sensitivity to the $\nu$e flavor. However, its backgrounds are not yet known. A major background is expected due to muon spallation of argon, which produces unstable isotopes that later beta decay. We present the first comprehensive study of MeV spallation backgrounds in argon, detailing isotope production mechanisms and decay properties, analyzing beta energy and time distributions, and proposing experimental cuts. We show that above a nominal detection threshold of 5 MeV, the most important backgrounds are --- surprisingly --- due to low-A isotopes, such as Li, Be, and B, even though high-A isotopes near argon are abundantly produced. We show that spallation backgrounds can be powerfully rejected by simple cuts, with clear paths for improvements. We compare these background rates to rates of possible MeV astrophysical neutrino signals in DUNE, including solar neutrinos (detailed in a companion paper arXiv:1808.08232), supernova burst neutrinos, and the diffuse supernova neutrino background. Further, to aid trigger strategies, we quantify the rates of single and multiple MeV events due to spallation, radiogenic neutron capture, and other backgrounds, including through pileup. Our overall conclusion is that DUNE has high potential for MeV neutrino astrophysics, but reaching this potential requires new experimental initiatives.},

The detector measures simultaneously the scintillation and the ionization produced by radiation in pure liquid xenon to discriminate signal from background down to 4.5 keV nuclear-recoil energy. A blind analysis of 58.6 live days of data, acquired between October 6, 2006, and February 14, 2007, and using a fiducial mass of 5.4 kg, excludes previously unexplored parameter space, setting a new 90% C.L. upper limit for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section of $8.8\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}44}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$, and $4.5\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}44}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $30\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$.

abstract = {Avalanche photodiodes, which operate above the breakdown voltage in Geiger mode connected with avalanche-quenching circuits, can be used to detect single photons and are therefore called single-photon avalanche diodes SPAD{\textquoteright}s. Circuit configurations suitable for this operation mode are critically analyzed and their relative merits in photon counting and timing applications are assessed. Simple passive-quenching circuits (PQC{\textquoteright}s), which are useful for SPAD device testing and selection, have fairly limited application. Suitably designed active-quenching circuits (AQC{\textquoteright}s) make it possible to exploit the best performance of SPAD{\textquoteright}s. Thick silicon SPAD{\textquoteright}s that operate at high voltages (250{\textendash}450 V) have photon detection efficiency higher than 50% from 540- to 850-nm wavelength and still {\textasciitilde}3% at 1064 nm. Thin silicon SPAD{\textquoteright}s that operate at low voltages (10{\textendash}50 V) have 45% efficiency at 500 nm, declining to 10% at 830 nm and to as little as 0.1% at 1064 nm. The time resolution achieved in photon timing is 20 ps FWHM with thin SPAD{\textquoteright}s; it ranges from 350 to 150 ps FWHM with thick SPAD{\textquoteright}s. The achieved minimum counting dead time and maximum counting rate are 40 ns and 10 Mcps with thick silicon SPAD{\textquoteright}s, 10 ns and 40 Mcps with thin SPAD{\textquoteright}s. Germanium and III{\textendash}V compound semiconductor SPAD{\textquoteright}s extend the range of photon-counting techniques in the near-infrared region to at least 1600-nm wavelength.},

We also present preliminary results of a calculation of the $^{82}\mathrm{Se}$ neutrinoless double-$\ensuremath{\beta}$ decay nuclear matrix element that corrects in part for the small size of the shell model single-particle space. The results of this work are important for designing next generation double-$\ensuremath{\beta}$ decay experiments and for the theoretical interpretations of their observations.},

If however DM-nucleus scattering leads to ionisation of the recoiling atom, the resulting electron may be detected even if the nuclear recoil is unobservable. We demonstrate that including this effect significantly enhances direct detection sensitivity to sub-GeV DM. Existing experiments set world-leading limits, and future experiments may probe the cross sections relevant for thermal freeze-out.},

abstract = {A high-resolution ($^{3}\mathrm{He},t$) charge-exchange experiment at an incident energy of 420 MeV has been performed on the double beta ($\ensuremath{\beta}\ensuremath{\beta}$) decay nucleus $^{82}\mathrm{Se}$. A detailed Gamow-Teller (${\mathrm{GT}}^{\ensuremath{-}}$) strength distribution in $^{82}\mathrm{Br}$ has been extracted, which provides information to the $\ensuremath{\beta}\ensuremath{\beta}$-decay nuclear matrix elements. Three strong and isolated transitions, which are to the 75, 1484 and the 2087 keV states in $^{82}\mathrm{Br}$, are found to dominate the low-excitation region below $\ensuremath{\approx}2.1$ MeV. Above 2.1 MeV a sudden onset of a strong GT fragmentation is observed. The degree of fragmentation resembles a situation found in the neighboring $A=76$ system $^{76}\mathrm{Ge}$, whereas the observed concentration of strength in the three low-lying states is reminiscent of the heavier neighbors $^{96}\mathrm{Zr}$ and $^{100}\mathrm{Mo}$. The strong GT transition to the 75 keV $({1}^{+})$ state makes $^{82}\mathrm{Se}$ interesting for solar neutrino detection. The $^{82}\mathrm{Se}({\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e},{e}^{\ensuremath{-}})^{82}\mathrm{Br}$ solar neutrino capture rate in a nonoscillation scenario is therefore evaluated to $668\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}12\text{(stat)}\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}60\text{(sys)}$ SNU, and some of the advantages of using selenium for solar neutrino studies are discussed.},

abstract = {While the first time-of-flight (TOF)-positron emission tomography (PET) systems were already built in the early 1980s, limited clinical studies were acquired on these scanners. PET was still a research tool, and the available TOF-PET systems were experimental. Due to a combination of low stopping power and limited spatial resolution (caused by limited light output of the scintillators), these systems could not compete with bismuth germanate (BGO)-based PET scanners. Developments on TOF system were limited for about a decade but started again around 2000. The combination of fast photomultipliers, scintillators with high density, modern electronics, and faster computing power for image reconstruction have made it possible to introduce this principle in clinical TOF-PET systems. This paper reviews recent developments in system design, image reconstruction, corrections, and the potential in new applications for TOF-PET. After explaining the basic principles of time-of-flight, the difficulties in detector technology and electronics to obtain a good and stable timing resolution are shortly explained. The available clinical systems and prototypes under development are described in detail. The development of this type of PET scanner also requires modified image reconstruction with accurate modeling and correction methods. The additional dimension introduced by the time difference motivates a shift from sinogram- to listmode-based reconstruction. This reconstruction is however rather slow and therefore rebinning techniques specific for TOF data have been proposed. The main motivation for TOF-PET remains the large potential for image quality improvement and more accurate quantification for a given number of counts. The gain is related to the ratio of object size and spatial extent of the TOF kernel and is therefore particularly relevant for heavy patients, where image quality degrades significantly due to increased attenuation (low counts) and high scatter fractions. The original calculations for the gain were based on analytical methods. Recent publications for iterative reconstruction have shown that it is difficult to quantify TOF gain into one factor. The gain depends on the measured distribution, the location within the object, and the count rate. In a clinical situation, the gain can be used to either increase the standardized uptake value (SUV) or reduce the image acquisition time or administered dose. The localized nature of the TOF kernel makes it possible to utilize local tomography reconstruction or to separate emission from transmission data. The introduction of TOF also improves the joint estimation of transmission and emission images from emission data only. TOF is also interesting for new applications of PET-like isotopes with low branching ratio for positron fraction. The local nature also reduces the need for fine angular sampling, which makes TOF interesting for limited angle situations like breast PET and online dose imaging in proton or hadron therapy. The aim of this review is to introduce the reader in an educational way into the topic of TOF-PET and to give an overview of the benefits and new opportunities in using this additional information.},

Twenty-five subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to receive Spirulina (study group) or to form the control group. At baseline, the control and study groups were matched for various variables. The efficacy of Spirulina supplementation (2 g/day for 2 months) was determined using the preintervention and postintervention blood glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and lipid profiles of the diabetic subjects. Two-month supplementation with Spirulina resulted in an appreciable lowering of fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose levels. A significant reduction in the HbA1c level was also observed, indicating improved long-term glucose regulation. With regard to lipids, triglyceride levels were significantly lowered.

abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) is a rapidly growing scienti?c discipline that is concerned with the sustainability of industrial systems under explicit consideration of its int- dependence with natural systems. In recent years, there has been an ever-increasing awareness about the applicability of Input-Output Analysis (IOA) to IE, in particular to LCA (life cycle assessment) and MFA (material ?ow analysis). This is witnessed in the growing number of papers at ISIE (International Society for Industrial Ec- ogy) conferences, which use IOA, and also by the installment of subject editors on IOA in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment. It can be said that IE has become a major ?eld of application for IOA. The broadening of users of IOA from various backgrounds implies a need for a self-contained textbook on IOA that can meet the needs of students and practitioners without compromising on basic c- cepts and the latest developments. This book was written with the aim of ?lling this need, and is primarily addressed to students and practitioners of IE. As the title suggests, the core contents of the book have grown out of our research in IOA of waste management issues over the last decade. We have been fascinated by the versatile nature of IOA with regard to various technical issues of waste m- agement in particular, and to IE in general. For us (both economists by training), IOA has turned out to be extremely useful in establishing productive communi- tion with scientists and engineers interested in IE.},

abstract = {Fluoroscopy is a low dose imaging technique. As such, a very sensitive detector is required to create images of good quality. Present day flat panel active matrix read out systems introduce an amount of noise that inhibits present direct and indirect methods from producing optimal quality images at fluoroscopic exposure rates (0.1{\textendash}10 $\mu$R per frame). The gain of the direct conversion approach using amorphous selenium (a-Se) was investigated to determine whether by increasing the applied electric field, a gain sufficient to overcome the noise limitations of the active matrix could be achieved. Conversion gain and avalanche multiplication in a-Se were investigated as a function of electric field from 10 to 100 V/$\mu$m. Our results show a factor of 4 increase in conversion gain is available by increasing electric field from the current standard of 10 V/$\mu$m to 100 V/$\mu$m. Furthermore, we show that avalanche multiplication can provide an additional gain of up to 25. This increase in signal is sufficient to overcome the noise level encountered in flat panel detectors and permit fully quantum noise limited operation across the whole fluoroscopic range of exposure.},

The calculations were done considering a 34 kton Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber similar to the Far Detector proposal of the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE). We have performed a Monte Carlo simulation for the number of events integrated in 5{\textasciitilde}ms bins. Our results are m$\nu$<2.71{\textasciitilde}eV and 0.18{\textasciitilde}{eV}<m$\nu$<1.70{\textasciitilde}eV, at 95% C.L, assuming normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy, respectively. We have analysed different configurations for the detector performance resulting in neutrino mass bound of O(1){\textasciitilde}eV.},

A critical performance parameter of an imaging detector is the Swank factor for degradation of the signal to noise ratio, or DQE(0), due to variations in the detector response. The Swank factor is evaluated from measured pulse height spectra generated by the absorption of monoenergetic x-rayphotons. The spectra show an additional width over previous theoretical expectations, but the Swank factor is still close to the high values previously predicted theoretically.},

These results are the first unambiguous demonstration of the capability of dual-phase xenon detectors to discriminate between electron and nuclear recoils down to 20 keV, a key requirement for a sensitive dark matter search.},

The effectiveness of ultrasound analysis in discriminating alpha-decay background events from single nuclear recoils has been confirmed, with a lower bound of ${\&}gt;99.3%$ rejection of alpha-decay events. Twenty single nuclear recoil event candidates and three multiple bubble events were observed during a total exposure of 553 kg-days distributed over three different bubble nucleation thresholds. The effective exposure for single bubble recoil-like events was 437.4 kg-days. A neutron background internal to the apparatus, of known origin, is estimated to account for five single nuclear recoil events and is consistent with the observed rate of multiple bubble events. The remaining excess of single bubble events exhibits characteristics indicating the presence of an additional background. These data provide new direct detection constraints on WIMP-proton spin-dependent scattering for WIMP masses ${\&}gt;20\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$ and demonstrate significant sensitivity for spin-independent interactions.},

abstract = {The CRESST experiment, located at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy, searches for dark matter particles via their elastic scattering off nuclei in a target material. The CRESST target consists of scintillating CaWO4 crystals, which are operated as cryogenic calorimeters at millikelvin temperatures. Each interaction in the CaWO4 target crystal produces a phonon signal and a light signal that is measured by a second cryogenic calorimeter. Since the CRESST-II result in 2015, the experiment is leading the field of direct dark matter search for dark matter masses below 1.7\,GeV/c2, extending the reach of direct searches to the sub-GeV/c2 mass region. For CRESST-III, whose Phase 1 started in July 2016, detectors have been optimized to reach the performance required to further probe the low-mass region with unprecedented sensitivity. In this contribution the achievements of the CRESST-III detectors will be discussed together with preliminary results and perspectives of Phase 1.},

abstract = {Plastic smart windows are becoming one of the key elements in view of the fabrication of inexpensive, lightweight electrochromic (EC) devices to be integrated in the new generation of high-energy-efficiency buildings and automotive applications. However, fabricating electrochromic devices on polymer substrates requires a reduction of process temperature, so in this work we focus on the development of a completely room-temperature deposition process aimed at the preparation of ITO-coated polycarbonate (PC) structures acting as transparent and conductive plastic supports. Without providing any substrate heating or surface activation pretreatments of the polymer, different deposition conditions are used for growing indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films by the radiofrequency magnetron sputtering technique. According to the characterization results, the set of optimal deposition parameters is selected to deposit ITO electrodes having high optical transmittance in the visible range (∼90%) together with low sheet re...},

abstract = {If dark energy, which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, consists of a light scalar field, it might be detectable as a "fifth force" between normal-matter objects, in potential conflict with precision tests of gravity. Chameleon fields and other theories with screening mechanisms, however, can evade these tests by suppressing the forces in regions of high density, such as the laboratory. Using a cesium matter-wave interferometer near a spherical mass in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber, we reduced the screening mechanism by probing the field with individual atoms rather than with bulk matter. We thereby constrained a wide class of dark energy theories, including a range of chameleon and other theories that reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration.},

abstract = {Despite the great success of the Standard Model of particle physics, a preponderance of astrophysical evidence suggests that it cannot explain most of the matter in the universe.
	This so-called dark matter has eluded direct detection, though many theoretical extensions to the Standard Model predict the existence of particles with a mass on the 1{\textendash}1000 GeV scale that interact only via the weak nuclear force. Particles in this class are referred to as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), and their high masses and low scattering cross sections make them viable dark matter candidates.
	The rarity of WIMP-nucleus interactions makes them challenging to detect: any background can mask the signal they produce. Background rejection is therefore a major problem in dark matter detection.
	Many experiments greatly reduce their backgrounds by employing techniques to reject electron recoils. However, nuclear recoil backgrounds, which produce signals similar to what we expect from WIMPs, remain problematic.
	There are two primary sources of such backgrounds: surface backgrounds and neutron recoils. Surface backgrounds result from radioactivity on the inner surfaces of the detector sending recoiling nuclei into the detector. These backgrounds can be removed with fiducial cuts, at some cost to the experiment{\textquoteright}s exposure. In this dissertation we briefly discuss a novel technique for rejecting these events based on signals they make in the wavelength shifter coating on the inner surfaces of some detectors.
	Neutron recoils result from neutrons scattering off of nuclei in the detector. These backgrounds may produce a signal identical to what we expect from WIMPs and are extensively discussed here. We additionally present a new tool for calculating ($\alpha$,n) yields in various materials.
	We introduce the concept of a neutron veto system designed to shield against, measure, and provide an anti-coincidence veto signal for background neutrons.
	We discuss the research and development that informed the design of the DarkSide-50 boron-loaded liquid scintillator neutron veto. We describe the specific implementation of this veto system in DarkSide-50, including a description of its performance, and show that it can reject neutrons with a high enough efficiency to allow DarkSide-50 to run background-free for three years.},

abstract = {The solar neutrino experiment Borexino, which is located in the Gran Sasso underground laboratories, is in a unique position to study muon-induced backgrounds in an organic liquid scintillator. In this study, a large sample of cosmic muons is identified and tracked by a muon veto detector external to the liquid scintillator, and by the specific light patterns observed when muons cross the scintillator volume. The yield of muon-induced neutrons is found to be Yn = (3.10{\textpm}0.11){\textperiodcentered}10{\textminus}4~n/($\mu${\textperiodcentered}(g/cm2)). The distance profile between the parent muon track and the neutron capture point has the average value $\lambda$ = (81.5{\textpm}2.7) cm. Additionally the yields of a number of cosmogenic radioisotopes are measured for 12N, 12B, 8He, 9C, 9Li, 8B, 6He, 8Li, 11Be, 10C and 11C. All results are compared with Monte Carlo simulation predictions using the FLUKA and GEANT4 packages. General agreement between data and simulation is observed for the cosmogenic production yields with a few exceptions, the most prominent case being 11C yield for which both codes return about 50% lower values. The predicted $\mu$-n distance profile and the neutron multiplicity distribution are found to be overall consistent with data.},

We show that for a depletion of 136Xe by a factor of 100 relative to its natural abundance, and an extension to electron recoil energies of  MeV, future xenon experiments with exposure  200 ton-yr can detect the CNO component of the solar neutrino flux at  3 $\sigma$ significance. A CNO detection will provide important insight into metallicity of the solar interior. Precise measurement of low-energy solar neutrinos, including as pp, 7Be, and pep components, will further improve constraints on the "neutrino luminosity" of the Sun, thereby providing constraints on alternative sources of energy production. We find that a measurement of L$\nu$/L of order one percent is possible with the above exposure, improving on current bounds from a global analysis of solar neutrino data by a factor of about seven.},

abstract = {Experimenters report an upper limit if the signal they are trying to detect is nonexistent or below their experiment's sensitivity. Such experiments may be contaminated with a background too poorly understood to subtract. If the background is distributed differently in some parameter from the expected signal, it is possible to take advantage of this difference to get a stronger limit than would be possible if the difference in distribution were ignored. We discuss the ``maximum gap'' method, which finds the best gap between events for setting an upper limit, and generalize to the ``optimum interval'' method, which uses intervals with especially few events. These methods, which apply to the case of relatively small backgrounds, do not use binning, are relatively insensitive to cuts on the range of the parameter, are parameter independent (i.e., do not change when a one-one change of variables is made), and provide true, though possibly conservative, classical one-sided confidence intervals.},

abstract = {We present an improved search for neutrinoless double-beta (0$\beta$$\beta$) decay of 136Xe in the KamLAND-Zen experiment. Owing to purification of the xenon-loaded liquid scintillator, we achieved a significant reduction of the 110mAg contaminant identified in previous searches. Combining the results from the first and second phase, we obtain a lower limit for the 0$\beta$$\beta$ decay half-life of T1/20$\nu$ > 1.07  1026 yr at 90% C.L., an almost sixfold improvement over previous limits. Using commonly adopted nuclear matrix element calculations, the corresponding upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass are in the range 61-165 meV. For the most optimistic nuclear matrix elements, this limit reaches the bottom of the quasi-degenerate neutrino mass region.},

abstract = {Forecasting the signal discrimination power of dark matter (DM) searches is commonly limited to a set of arbitrary benchmark points. We introduce new methods for benchmark-free forecasting that instead allow an exhaustive exploration and visualization of the phenomenological distinctiveness of DM models, based on standard hypothesis testing. Using this method, we reassess the signal discrimination power of future liquid Xenon and Argon direct DM searches. We quantify the parameter regions where various non-relativistic effective operators, millicharged DM, and magnetic dipole DM can be discriminated, and where upper limits on the DM mass can be found. We find that including an Argon target substantially improves the prospects for reconstructing the DM properties. We also show that only in a small region with DM masses in the range 20-100 GeV and DM-nucleon cross sections a factor of a few below current bounds can near-future Xenon and Argon detectors discriminate both the DM-nucleon interaction and the DM mass simultaneously. In all other regions only one or the other can be obtained.},

abstract = {A dedicated test of the effects of Oxygen contamination in liquid Argon has been performed at the INFN-Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS, Italy) within the WArP R{\&}D program. Two detectors have been used: the WArP2.3 lt prototype and a small (0.7 lt) dedicated detector, coupled with a system for the injection of controlled amounts of gaseous Oxygen. O2 contamination in LAr leads to depletion of both the free electron charge (via attachment process) and the scintillation light (via quenching and absorption mechanisms) available for ionization signal detection. Purpose of the test with the 0.7 lt detector was to detect the reduction of the long-lived component lifetime of the Argon scintillation light emission and of the overall light yield at increasing O2 concentration. Data from the WArP prototype were used for determining the behavior of both the ionization electron lifetime and the scintillation long-lived component lifetime at decreasing O2 concentration by the purification process activated in closed loop during the acquisition run. The electron lifetime measurements allowed to infer the O2 content of the Argon and correlate it with the long-lived scintillation lifetime data. The effects of Oxygen contamination on the scintillation light have been thus extensively measured over a wide range of O2 concentration, spanning from {\textasciitilde} 10{\textminus}3 ppm up to {\textasciitilde} 10 ppm.},

abstract = {The standard model of hot big-bang cosmology requires initial conditions which are problematic in two ways: (1) The early universe is assumed to be highly homogeneous, in spite of the fact that separated regions were causally disconnected (horizon problem); and (2) the initial value of the Hubble constant must be fine tuned to extraordinary accuracy to produce a universe as flat (i.e., near critical mass density) as the one we see today (flatness problem). These problems would disappear if, in its early history, the universe supercooled to temperatures 28 or more orders of magnitude below the critical temperature for some phase transition. A huge expansion factor would then result from a period of exponential growth, and the entropy of the universe would be multiplied by a huge factor when the latent heat is released. Such a scenario is completely natural in the context of grand unified models of elementary-particle interactions. In such models, the supercooling is also relevant to the problem of monopole suppression. Unfortunately, the scenario seems to lead to some unacceptable consequences, so modifications must be sought.},

We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology.},

abstract = {The use of high resistivity amorphous solids as photodetectors, especially amorphous selenium, is currently of great interest because they are readily produced over large area at substantially lower cost compared to grown crystalline solids. However, amorphous solids have been ruled out as viable radiation detection media for high frame-rate applications, such as single-photon-counting imaging, because of low carrier mobilities, transit-time-limited photoresponse, and consequently, poor time resolution. To circumvent the problem of poor charge transport in amorphous solids, we propose unipolar time-differential charge sensing by establishing a strong near-field effect using an electrostatic shield within the material. For the first time, we have fabricated a true Frisch grid inside a solid-state detector by evaporating amorphous selenium over photolithographically prepared multi-well substrates. The fabricated devices are characterized with optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray impulse-like excitations. Results prove the proposed unipolar time-differential property and show that time resolution in non-dispersive amorphous solids can be improved substantially to reach the theoretical limit set by spatial spreading of the collected Gaussian carrier cloud.},

abstract = {The CUORE experiment, a ton-scale cryogenic bolometer array, recently began operation at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The array represents a significant advancement in this technology, and in this work we apply it for the first time to a high-sensitivity search for a lepton-number--violating process: 130Te neutrinoless double-beta decay. Examining a total TeO2 exposure of 86.3 kgyr, characterized by an effective energy resolution of (7.7  0.5) keV FWHM and a background in the region of interest of (0.014  0.002) counts/(keVkgyr), we find no evidence for neutrinoless double-beta decay. The median statistical sensitivity of this search is 7.01024 yr. Including systematic uncertainties, we place a lower limit on the decay half-life of T0$\nu$1/2(130Te) > 1.3 1025 yr (90% C.L.). Combining this result with those of two earlier experiments, Cuoricino and CUORE-0, we find T0$\nu$1/2(130Te) > 1.5 1025 yr (90% C.L.), which is the most stringent limit to date on this decay. Interpreting this result as a limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass, we find m$\beta$$\beta$<(140 - 400) meV, where the range reflects the nuclear matrix element estimates employed.},

abstract = {The spherical acrylic vessel that contains the liquid argon target is the most critical detector component in the DEAP-3600 dark matter experiment. Alpha decays near the inner surface of the acrylic vessel are one of the main sources of background in the detector. A fraction of the alpha energy, or the recoiling nucleus from the alpha decay, could misreconstruct in the fiducial volume and result in a false candidate dark matter event. Acrylic has low levels of inherent contamination from 238U and 232Th. Another background of particular concern is diffusion of 222Rn during manufacturing, leading to 210Pb contamination. The maximum acceptable concentrations in the DEAP-3600 acrylic vessel are ppt levels of 238U and 232Th equivalent, and 10{\textminus}8 ppt 210Pb. The impurities in the bulk acrylic will be measured by vaporizing a large quantity of acrylic and counting the concentrated residue with ultra-low background HPGe detectors and a low background alpha spectrometer.

abstract = {A search for the standard model Higgs boson ($H$) decaying to $b\overline{b}$ when produced in association with a weak vector boson ($V$) is reported for the following channels: $W(\ensuremath{\mu}\ensuremath{\nu})H$, $W(e\ensuremath{\nu})H$, $W(\ensuremath{\tau}\ensuremath{\nu})H$, $Z(\ensuremath{\mu}\ensuremath{\mu})H$, $Z(ee)H$, and $Z(\ensuremath{\nu}\ensuremath{\nu})H$. The search is performed in data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at $\sqrt{s}=7\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{TeV}$ and up to $18.9\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{fb}}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{TeV}$, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. An excess of events is observed above the expected background with a local significance of 2.1 standard deviations for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, consistent with the expectation from the production of the standard model Higgs boson. The signal strength corresponding to this excess, relative to that of the standard model Higgs boson, is $1.0\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.5$.},

Data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $20.3\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{fb}}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ have been collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The observed data are well described by the expected standard model backgrounds. Upper limits on the cross section of events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson candidate are also placed.

Differences between the vapor pressure of a highly enriched sample of 36Ar and that of natural argon were measured simultaneously with the absolute vapor pressure of natural argon. Absolute and differential vapor pressure measurements show an estimated accuracy of 0.15% and 0.001%, respectively, with respect to the absolute vapor pressure of argon. Data were obtained in both the solid and liquid regions. The vapor pressure of 36Ar is always higher than that of 40Ar by about 0.5%. Triple-point temperatures and pressures were also measured for both isotopes. All data compare favorably with previous results reported in the literature and are nicely interpreted within the framework of Bigeleisen's theory of isotope effects. Using a large temperature extrapolation of our data, liquid{\textminus}vapor isot...},

abstract = {NH3 decomposition is important because of its potential use in generating CO-free H2. In this study, several cheap metals (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) and a series of supports (zeolite materials: TS-1 um, TS-1 nm, HZSM-5 nm, and NaZSM-5 nm; SiO2-based materials: fumed SiO2 and SiO2-ball; and metal oxide materials: r{\textasciiacute}-Al2O3 and TiO2) were used to prepare supported catalysts. X-ray fluorescence, N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, mass spectrometry, temperature-programmed reduction, and electrical property analysis were used to investigate the effect of the catalyst on the synergy between a plasma (produced by dielectric barrier discharge) and the catalyst in NH3 decomposition. The results show that the synergy depends strongly on the strength of the metal{\textendash}nitrogen (M{\textendash}N) bond, and the relative dielectric constant ($\varepsilon$d) of the support. When Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu were supported on fumed SiO2, the order of the st...},

abstract = {The most common method for time pick-off from signals coming from SiPMs coupled to scintillator crystals in PET applications is the Leading Edge Triggering. In this work we propose a new filtering scheme to be applied before the discriminator. It implements a type of baseline compensation aimed at the reduction of the time jitter due to the dark counts of the detector and is based on a simple analog filter, which is well suited for an ASIC implementation. We describe a circuit, built with discrete components, that implements the filter. Finally we report on the Coincidence Resolving Time measurements performed coupling the circuit to the real detector, composed of a SiPM built at FBK and a LYSO crystal, for the detection of 511 keV photons. The results obtained are promising, showing that the method is quite effective in reducing the impact of the detector noise on the timing performance of the system.},

Data sets with a total live-time of 3.2 years within a 4.2-year span are analyzed with physics threshold of 250 eVee. Limits on WIMP-nucleus ({$\chi$}N) spin-independent cross-sections as function of WIMP mass (m$\chi$) at 90% confidence level (C.L.) are derived using the Halo Dark Matter model. The 90% C.L. allowed regions implied by the DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT AM-based analysis are excluded at >99.99% and 98% C.L., respectively. These results correspond to the best sensitivity at m$\chi$<6{\textasciitilde}{ GeV/c2} among WIMP AM measurements to date.},

abstract = {We present results of a dark matter search performed with a 0.6 kg d exposure of the DAMIC experiment at the SNOLAB underground laboratory. We measure the energy spectrum of ionization events in the bulk silicon of charge-coupled devices down to a signal of 60 eV electron equivalent. The data are consistent with radiogenic backgrounds, and constraints on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic-scattering cross section are accordingly placed. A region of parameter space relevant to the potential signal from the CDMS-II Si experiment is excluded using the same target for the first time. This result obtained with a limited exposure demonstrates the potential to explore the low-mass WIMP region (${\&}lt;10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}\text{ }{c}^{\ensuremath{-}2}$) with the upcoming DAMIC100, a 100 g detector currently being installed in SNOLAB.},

This method can be used to obtain good energy resolution from detectors in which only one polarity type of carriers is efficiently collected.

The distribution of radon and its daughters within the counter under various conditions was determined by comparison of observed and calculated counting efficiencies. A stable counting efficiency of 5.58{\textpm}0.05 cpm/$\mu$$\mu$c radon and a background counting rate of 0.08 cpm is obtained. The usefulness of this counter is augmented by adsorbing the radon on charcoal. The radon is then easily transferred to the counter with a small volume of helium and a Sigmamotor pump. This system is suitable for the analysis of samples of radon as small as 10{\textminus}14 c or concentrations in air smaller than 10{\textminus}16 C radon/liter.},

The program can be used both in dark and under continuous low-level light illumination. It grabs 1ms-long waveforms, each containing many single cell pulses, from an oscilloscope connected to the PC via Ethernet. On-line data analysis is done both on the raw waveform as well as on a filtered (with DLED technique) version in order to facilitate the pulse identification and the extraction of some parameters also in cases of high count rates or cross-talk. The main outcomes of the program are: single-cell signal shape, gain, primary dark count rate, after-pulse probability, direct and delayed cross-talk probability and excess charge factor. It can be used also to determine the actual photo-detection efficiency with the proper hardware set-up.},

abstract = {The Sun is fueled by a series of nuclear reactions that produce the energy that makes it shine.  								 Neutrinos ({\&}nu;) produced by these nuclear reactions exit the Sun  								 and reach Earth within minutes, providing us with key information 								 about what goes on at the core of our star. For over twenty years since the first detection of solar neutrinos in the late 1960's, an apparent deficit in their detection rate was known as the <italic>Solar Neutrino Problem</italic>. Today, the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect is the accepted mechanism by which neutrinos oscillate inside the Sun, arriving at Earth as a mixture of {\&}nu;e, {\&}nu;{\&}mu; and {\&}nu;{\&}tau;, the latter two of which were invisible to early detectors. 								 Several experiments have now confirmed the observation of neutrino oscillations. 								 These experiments, when their results are combined together, have demonstrated that neutrino oscillations are well described by the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solution of the MSW effect. 								 This thesis presents the first measurement of <italic>pp</italic> neutrinos in the Borexino detector, which is another validation of the LMA-MSW model of neutrino oscillations.  								 In addition, it is one more step towards the completion of the spectroscopy of <italic>pp</italic> chain neutrinos in Borexino, leaving only the extremely faint <italic>hep</italic> neutrinos undetected. This advance validates the experiment itself and its previous results. 								 This is, furthermore, the first direct real-time measurement of <italic>pp</italic> neutrinos. 								 We find a <italic>pp</italic> neutrino detection rate of 143{\&}plusmn;16 (stat){\&}plusmn;10 (syst) cpd/100 t in the Borexino experiment, which translates, according to the LMA-MSW model, to (6.42{\&}plusmn;0.85){\&}times;10<super>10</super> cm<super>-2</super> s<super>-1</super>. 								 We also report on a measurement of neutrons in a dedicated system within the Borexino detector, which resulted in an improved understanding of neutron rates in liquid scintillator detectors at Gran Sasso depths. 								 This result is crucial to the development of novel direct dark matter detection experiments.},

abstract = {Yield of secondaries and ratio of variance to yield (Fano factor) are associated with a simple statistical model. This model applies almost independently of details of the physics, though introduction in it of refinements from band structure would be straightforward. The model is described in terminology of an equivalent problem which is formulated and called "crazy carpentry." Analytical and Monte Carlo results agree well. The statistics are largely determined at secondary energies of just a few ionization thresholds, above which yield increases linearly with energy, with an apparent threshold the same as the average final energy, or energy of a secondary when first it cannot ionize further. Limiting relative yield, equal to ionization threshold divided by average energy per electron-hole pair, and Fano factor are given in their dependence on losses to optical phonons. The limiting case of given relative energy loss to very many phonons of very small energy generally provides close approximations, so that the results apply also whatever kinds of phonons are produced. Illustrative simple cases are also treated, including the one-dimensional space-filling problem known as the "parking problem." The theoretical yield is used to fit data of Vavilov on the enhanced quantum yield in silicon, and some physical implications are considered.},

abstract = {Next generation multi-ton scale noble liquid experiments have the unique opportunity to discover dark matter particles at the TeV scale, reaching the sensitivity of 10{\textminus}48 cm2 in the WIMP nucleon scattering cross-section. A prerequisite will be the reduction of radiogenic background sources to negligible levels. This is only possible if ultra-pure high efficiency photosensors are available for the scintillation light readout. Current experiments (e.g. Xenon, LUX, Darkside, ArDM) use cryogenic PMTs as photosensors. An attractive alternative is represented by silicon photomultiplier arrays (SiPM arrays), which show unrivalled performances in single photon detection. This paper reports on the performance of the SensL-ArrayB-30035-16P SiPM array and a custom made cryogenic front-end board at the liquid argon temperature. Its performance at VOV=3.5 V, where the PDE is maximal, are very promising in terms of SPE resolution (about 8%), dark rate (about 250 Hz) and correlated pulses (30%).},

abstract = {If weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) are the dark matter in the galactic halo, they may be detected in low-background ionization detectors now operating or with low-temperature devices under development. In detecting WIMP's of low mass or WIMP's with spin-dependent nuclear interactions (e.g., photinos), a principal technical difficulty appears to be achieving very low thresholds (\ensuremath{\lesssim} keV) in large (\ensuremath{\sim} kg) detectors with low background noise. We present an analytic treatment of WIMP detection and show that the seasonal modulation of the signal can be used to detect WIMP's even at low-signal-to-background levels and thus without the necessity of going to very-low-energy thresholds. As a result, the prospects for detecting a variety of cold-dark-matter candidates may be closer at hand than previously thought. We discuss in detail the detector characteristics required for a number of WIMP candidates, and carefully work out expected event rates for several present and proposed detectors.},

Large water clusters with n = 80{\textminus}100 resulted in a reasonable estimate of the 16O/18O vpie, which was in contrast to the one for which only small water clusters had been considered. Contrary to this, no appreciable improvement in the H/D vpie reproduction by using large water clusters was observed.},

abstract = {The edible alga Spirulina platensis was uniformly labeled with 13C by growth in an atmosphere of pure 13CO2. The labeled biomass was then incorporated into the diet of a laying hen for 27 days. The isotopic enrichment of individual amino acids in egg white and yolk proteins, as well as in various tissues of the hen at the end of the feeding period, was analyzed by negative chemical ionization gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The amino acids of successive eggs showed one of two exclusive enrichment patterns: complete preservation of the intact carbon skeleton or extensive degradation and resynthesis. The same observation was made in tissue proteins. These patterns were cleanly divided according to known nutritional amino acid essentiality/nonessentiality but revealed differences in labeling among the nonessential amino acids: most notable was that proline accretion was derived entirely from the diet. Feeding uniformly 13C-labeled algal protein and recovering and analyzing de novo-synthesized protein provides a useful method to examine amino acid metabolism and determine conditional amino acid essentially in vivo.},

abstract = {The Argon Dark Matter (ArDM-1t) experiment is a ton-scale liquid argon (LAr) double-phase time projection chamber designed for direct Dark Matter searches. Such a device allows to explore the low energy frontier in LAr with a charge imaging detector. The ionization charge is extracted from the liquid into the gas phase and there amplified by the use of a Large Electron Multiplier in order to reduce the detection threshold. Direct detection of the ionization charge with fine spatial granularity, combined with a measurement of the amplitude and time evolution of the associated primary scintillation light, provide powerful tools for the identification of WIMP interactions against the background due to electrons, photons and possibly neutrons if scattering more than once. A one ton LAr detector is presently installed on surface at CERN to fully test all functionalities and it will be soon moved to an underground location. We will emphasize here the lessons learned from such a device for the design of a large LAr TPC for neutrino oscillation, proton decay and astrophysical neutrinos searches.},

abstract = {Since the secondary scintillation signals of dual phase Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detectors are produced through noble gas electroluminescence, a comprehen- sive understanding of electroluminescence is essential for the design and simulation of a future detector.
In this dissertation, I determine a fundamental property, the field dependence of light yield, of argon electroluminescence, using data from DarkSide-50 (DS-50), a detector designed for direct detection of dark matter.
The analysis requires a good understanding of the detector geometry in the sec- ondary scintillation region of DS-50. However, deformations of the detector compo- nents are implied by the data, and they cannot be directly measured. I thus determine the field dependence under two hypotheses for the deformations. The results obtained by applying the different hypotheses have systematic differences, but are close to each other and agree with the results from other studies.
The results from this study are applied to predict the secondary scintillation light yield and its stability for different design schemes for DarkSide-20k (DS-20k), the next generation of DarkSide detector.},

abstract = {ARIADNE is a research project for the development of innovative two-phase optical LAr TPC readouts. Optical readout presents several considerable advantages when compared to traditional segmented THGEM (THick Gaseous Electron Multiplier) charge readout technologies, such as ease of scalability, upgrade, installation and maintenance, cost effectiveness and simplicity. This paper presents the first demonstration of 3D particle tracking in a TPC using purely optical readout. By combining an optically sensitive Timepix3 (TPX3) sensor with an image intensifier a single photon sensitive camera has been developed. TPX3, operated in data driven mode, provides both arrival time (ToA) information and charge deposit information (ToT) together with the coordinates of the active pixel when light is received. Since charge produced in a TPC is drifted over time it is possible to perform full 3D reconstruction by combining the (x,y) pixel information with ToA information. ToT information provides a measure of intensity in each pixel and enables calorimetry. Both an Americium-241 alpha source and cosmic rays have been imaged in 100mbar CF4.},

By dropping the requirement of a scintillation signal and using only the ionization signal to determine the interaction energy, we lowered the energy threshold for detection to 0.7 keV for nuclear recoils. No dark matter detection can be claimed because a complete background model cannot be constructed without a primary scintillation signal. Instead, we compute an upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section under the assumption that every event passing our selection criteria could be a signal event. Using an energy interval from 0.7 keV to 9.1 keV, we derive a limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section that excludes WIMPs with a mass of $6\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ above $1.4\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}41}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ at 90% confidence level.},

abstract = {While cosmic ray muons themselves are relatively easy to veto in underground detectors, their interactions with nuclei create more insidious backgrounds via (i) the decays of long-lived isotopes produced by muon-induced spallation reactions inside the detector, (ii) spallation reactions initiated by fast muon-induced neutrons entering from outside the detector, and (iii) nuclear recoils initiated by fast muon-induced neutrons entering from outside the detector. These backgrounds, which are difficult to veto or shield against; are very important for solar, reactor, dark matter, and other underground experiments, especially as increased sensitivity is pursued. We used FLUKA to calculate the production rates and spectra of all prominent secondaries produced by cosmic ray muons, in particular focusing on secondary neutrons, because of their importance. Since the neutron spectrum is steeply falling, the total neutron production rate is sensitive to just the relatively soft neutrons and not the fast-neutron component. We show that the neutron spectrum in the range \ensuremath{\sim}10\char21{}100 MeV can instead be probed by the $(n,p)$-induced isotope production rates $^{12}\mathrm{C}$$(n,p)$$^{12}\mathrm{B}$ and $^{16}\mathrm{O}$$(n,p)$$^{16}\mathrm{N}$ in oil- and water-based detectors. The result for $^{12}\mathrm{B}$ is in good agreement with the recent KamLAND measurement. Besides testing the calculation of muon secondaries, these results are also of practical importance, since $^{12}\mathrm{B}$ (${T}_{1/2}=20.2$ ms, $Q=13.4\phantom{\rule{0.3em}{0ex}}\text{MeV}$) and $^{16}\mathrm{N}$ (${T}_{1/2}=7.13$ s, $Q=10.4\phantom{\rule{0.3em}{0ex}}\text{MeV}$) are among the dominant spallation backgrounds in these detectors.},

abstract = {The count rate of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter candidates in direct detection experiments experiences an annual modulation due to the Earth's motion around the Sun. In the standard isothermal halo model, the signal peaks near June 2nd at high recoil energies; however, the signal experiences a phase reversal and peaks in December at low energy recoils. We show that this phase reversal may be used to determine the WIMP mass. If an annual modulation were observed with the usual phase (i.e., peaking on June 2nd) in the lowest accessible energy recoil bins of the DAMA, CDMS-II, CRESST-II, EDELWEISS-II, GENIUS-TF, ZEPLIN-II, XENON, or ZEPLIN-IV detectors, one could immediately place upper bounds on the WIMP mass of 103, 48, 6, 97, 10, 52, 29, and 29 GeV, respectively. In addition, detectors with adequate energy resolution and sufficiently low recoil energy thresholds may determine the crossover recoil energy at which the phase reverses, thereby obtaining an independent measurement of the WIMP mass. We study the capabilities of various detectors, and find that CRESST-II, ZEPLIN-II, and GENIUS-TF should be able to observe the phase reversal in a few years of runtime, and can thus determine the mass of the WIMP if it is $O(100\mathrm{GeV}).$ Xenon based detectors with 1000 kg (XENON and ZEPLIN-IV) and with energy recoil thresholds of a few keV require 25 kg yr exposure, which will be readily attained in upcoming experiments.},

abstract = {Tidal streams of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) may be showering dark matter onto the solar system and contributing $\ensuremath{\sim}(0.3\char21{}23)%$ of the local density of our galactic halo. If the Sagittarius galaxy contains dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), the extra contribution from the stream gives rise to a steplike feature in the energy recoil spectrum in direct dark matter detection. For our best estimate of stream velocity (300 km/s) and direction (the plane containing the Sgr dwarf and its debris), the count rate is maximum on June 28 and minimum on December 27 (for most recoil energies), and the location of the step oscillates yearly with a phase opposite to that of the count rate. In the CDMS experiment, for 60 GeV WIMPs, the location of the step oscillates between 35 and 42 keV, and for the most favorable stream density, the stream should be detectable at the $11\ensuremath{\sigma}$ level in four years of data with 10 keV energy bins. Planned large detectors like XENON, CryoArray, and the directional detector DRIFT may also be able to identify the Sgr stream.},

In order to achieve high precision in the determination of neutrino rates, the detector design includes an internal and an external calibration system. This paper describes both calibration systems and the calibration campaigns that were carried out in the period between 2008 and 2011. We discuss some of the results and show that the calibration procedures preserved the radiopurity of the scintillator. The calibrations provided a detailed understanding of the detector response and led to a significant reduction of the systematic uncertainties in the Borexino measurements.},

abstract = {Existing xenon dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments can probe the DM-nucleon interaction of DM with a sub-GeV mass through a search for photon emission from the recoiling xenon atom. We show that LUX's constraints on sub-GeV DM, which utilize the scintillation (S1) and ionization (S2) signals, are approximately 3 orders of magnitude more stringent than previous xenon constraints in this mass range, derived from the XENON10 and XENON100 S2-only searches. The new LUX constraints provide the most stringent direct detection constraints for DM particles with a mass below 0.5 GeV. In addition, the photon emission signal in LUX and its successor LZ maintain the discrimination between background and signal events so that an unambiguous discovery of sub-GeV DM is possible. We show that LZ has the potential to reconstruct the DM mass with $\ensuremath{\simeq}20%$ accuracy for particles lighter than 0.5 GeV.},

abstract = {We report results of a search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS) with the silicon detectors of the CDMS II experiment. This blind analysis of 140.2 kg day of data taken between July 2007 and September 2008 revealed three WIMP-candidate events with a surface-event background estimate of ${0.41}_{\ensuremath{-}0.08}^{+0.20}(\mathrm{stat}{)}_{\ensuremath{-}0.24}^{+0.28}(\mathrm{syst})$. Other known backgrounds from neutrons and $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ are limited to ${\&}lt;0.13$ and ${\&}lt;0.08$ events at the 90% confidence level, respectively. The exposure of this analysis is equivalent to 23.4 kg day for a recoil energy range of 7\char21{}100 keV for a WIMP of mass $10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$. The probability that the known backgrounds would produce three or more events in the signal region is 5.4%. A profile likelihood ratio test of the three events that includes the measured recoil energies gives a 0.19% probability for the known-background-only hypothesis when tested against the alternative $\mathrm{\text{WIMP}}+\mathrm{\text{background}}$ hypothesis. The highest likelihood occurs for a WIMP mass of $8.6\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ and WIMP-nucleon cross section of $1.9\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}41}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$.},

abstract = {ANAIS is a direct detection dark matter experiment aiming at the testing of the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation result, which standing for about two decades has neither been confirmed nor ruled out by any other experiment in a model independent way. ANAIS-112, consisting of 112.5 kg of sodium iodide crystals, is taking data at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory, Spain, since August 2017. This letter presents the annual modulation analysis of 1.5 years of data, amounting to 157.55 kgy. We focus on the model independent analysis searching for modulation and the validation of our sensitivity prospects. ANAIS-112 data are consistent with the null hypothesis (p-values of 0.65 and 0.16 for [2-6] and [1-6] keV energy regions, respectively). The best fits for the modulation hypothesis are consistent with the absence of modulation (Sm=-0.00440.0058 cpd/kg/keV and -0.00150.0063 cpd/kg/keV, respectively). They are in agreement with our estimated sensitivity for the accumulated exposure, supporting our projected goal of reaching a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to the DAMA/LIBRA result in 5 years of data taking.},

abstract = {Decays of radioisotopes on inner detector surfaces can pose a major background concern for the direct detection of dark matter. While these backgrounds are conventionally mitigated with position cuts, these cuts reduce the exposure of the detector by decreasing the sensitive mass, and uncertainty in position determination may make it impossible to adequately remove such events in certain detectors. In this paper, we provide a new technique for substantially reducing these surface backgrounds in liquid argon (LAr) detectors, independent of position cuts. These detectors typically use a coating of tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB) on the inner surfaces as a wavelength shifter to convert vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) LAr scintillation light to the visible spectrum. We find that TPB scintillation contains a component with a previously unreported exceptionally long lifetime ($\ensuremath{\sim}\mathrm{ms}$). We discovered that this component differs significantly in magnitude between alpha, beta, and VUV excitation, which enables the use of pulse shape discrimination to suppress surface backgrounds by more than a factor of $1{0}^{3}$ with negligible loss of dark matter sensitivity. We also discuss how this technique can be extended beyond just LAr experiments.},

abstract = {Direct detection experiments, which are designed to detect the scattering of dark matter off nuclei in detectors, are a critical component in the search for the Universe's missing matter. This Colloquium begins with a review of the physics of direct detection of dark matter, discussing the roles of both the particle physics and astrophysics in the expected signals. The count rate in these experiments should experience an annual modulation due to the relative motion of the Earth around the Sun. This modulation, not present for most known background sources, is critical for solidifying the origin of a potential signal as dark matter. The focus is on the physics of annual modulation, discussing the practical formulas needed to interpret a modulating signal. The dependence of the modulation spectrum on the particle and astrophysics models for the dark matter is illustrated. For standard assumptions, the count rate has a cosine dependence with time, with a maximum in June and a minimum in December. Well-motivated generalizations of these models, however, can affect both the phase and amplitude of the modulation. Shown is how a measurement of an annually modulating signal could teach us about the presence of substructure in the galactic halo or about the interactions between dark and baryonic matter. Although primarily a theoretical review, the current experimental situation for annual modulation and future experimental directions is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Liquified noble gases are widely used as a target in direct Dark Matter searches. Signals from scintillation in the liquid, following energy deposition from the recoil nuclei scattered by Dark Matter particles (e.g. WIMPs), should be recorded down to very low energies by photosensors suitably designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Liquid Argon based detectors for Dark Matter searches currently implement photomultiplier tubes for signal read-out. In the last few years PMTs with photocathodes operating down to liquid Argon temperatures (87 K) have been specially developed with increasing Quantum Efficiency characteristics. The most recent of these, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. Mod. R11065 with peak QE up to about 35%, has been extensively tested within the R{\&}D program of the WArP Collaboration. During these tests the Hamamatsu PMTs showed excellent performance and allowed obtaining a light yield around 7 phel/keVee in a Liquid Argon detector with a photocathodic coverage in the 12% range, sufficient for detection of events down to few keVee of energy deposition. This shows that this new type of PMT is suited for experimental applications, in particular for new direct Dark Matter searches with LAr-based experiments.},

abstract = {A recent proposal is that dark matter could be a thermal relic of $3\ensuremath{\rightarrow}2$ scatterings in a strongly coupled hidden sector. We present explicit classes of strongly coupled gauge theories that admit this behavior. These are QCD-like theories of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, where the pions play the role of dark matter. The number-changing $3\ensuremath{\rightarrow}2$ process, which sets the dark matter relic abundance, arises from the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. The theories give an explicit relationship between the $3\ensuremath{\rightarrow}2$ annihilation rate and the $2\ensuremath{\rightarrow}2$ self-scattering rate, which alters predictions for structure formation. This is a simple calculable realization of the strongly interacting massive-particle mechanism.},

abstract = {The imaging performance of an amorphous selenium (a- Se ) flat-panel detector for digital fluoroscopy was experimentally evaluated using the spatial frequency dependent modulation transfer function(MTF),noise power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). These parameters were investigated at beam qualities and exposures within the range typical of gastrointestinal fluoroscopic imaging (∼0.1{\textendash}10 $\mu$ R , 75 kV). The investigation does not take into consideration the detector cover, which in clinical use will lower the DQE measured here by its percent attenuation. The MTF was found to be less than the expected aperture response and the NPS was not white which together indicate presampling blurring. The cause of this blurring was attributed to charge trapping at the interface between two different layers of the a- Se . The effect on the DQE was also consistent with presampling blur, which reduces the aliasing in the NPS and thereby reduces the spatial frequency dependence of the DQE. (The DQE was independent of spatial frequency from 0.12 to 0.73  mm {\textminus}1 due to antialiasing of the NPS.) Moreover, the first zero of the measured MTF and the aperture response appeared at the same spatial frequency (6.66  mm {\textminus}1 for a pixel of 150 $\mu$m). Hence, the geometric fill factor (77%) was increased to an effective fill factor of 99{\textpm}1%. A large scale (∼32  pixels ) correlation in the noise due to the configuration of the readout electronics caused increased noise power in the gate line NPS at low spatial frequency ({\&}lt;0.1  mm {\textminus}1 ). The DQE (f=0) was exposure independent over a large range of exposures but became exposure dependent at low exposures due to the electronic noise.},

abstract = {When backgrounds are not well enough controlled to measure the value of some physical parameter, one may still obtain an upper limit on the parameter. A single experiment may have several detectors, each of which can alone be used to derive an upper limit from the set of detected events, and the experiment can be run during multiple periods. There can also be more than one experiment which produces an upper limit. Six methods are discussed for producing a combined upper limit. These methods all assume use of either the optimum interval method or the maximum gap method for finding an upper limit in the face of poorly known background.},

abstract = {The Bayesian discovery probability of future experiments searching for neutrinoless double-$\ensuremath{\beta}$ decay is evaluated under the popular assumption that neutrinos are their own antiparticles. A Bayesian global fit is performed to construct a probability distribution for the effective Majorana mass, the observable of interest for these experiments. This probability distribution is then combined with the sensitivity of each experiment derived from a heuristic counting analysis. The discovery probability is found to be higher than previously considered, but strongly depends on whether the neutrino mass ordering is normal or inverted. For the inverted ordering, next-generation experiments are likely to observe a signal already during their first operational stages. Even for the normal ordering, in the absence of neutrino mass mechanisms that drive the lightest state or the effective Majorana mass to zero, the probability of discovering neutrinoless double-$\ensuremath{\beta}$ decay can reach $\ensuremath{\sim}50%$ or more in the most promising experiments.},

abstract = {We present the first simultaneous measurement of the interaction rates of pp, 7Be, and pep solar neutrinos performed with a global fit to the Borexino data in an extended energy range (0.19-2.93)\,MeV. This result was obtained by analyzing 1291.51\,days of Borexino Phase-II data, collected between December 2011 and May 2016 after an extensive scintillator purification campaign. We find: rate(pp)\,=\,134\,\,10\,(stat)\, +6 -10\,(sys)\,cpd/100\,t, rate(7Be)\,=\,48.3\,\,1.1\,(stat)\, +0.4 -0.7\,(sys)\,cpd/100\,t, and rate(pep)\,=\,2.43\,0.36\,(stat)+0.15-0.22\,(sys)\,cpd/100\,t. These numbers are in agreement with and improve the precision of our previous measurements. In particular, the interaction rate of 7Be $\nu$'s is measured with an unprecedented precision of 2.7%, showing that discriminating between the high and low metallicity solar models is now largely dominated by theoretical uncertainties. The absence of pep neutrinos is rejected for the first time at more than 5\,$\sigma$. An upper limit of 8.1\,cpd/100\,t (95%\,C.L.) on the CNO neutrino rate is obtained by setting an additional constraint on the ratio between the pp and pep neutrino rates in the fit. This limit has the same significance as that obtained by the Borexino Phase-I (currently providing the tightest bound on this component), but is obtained by applying a less stringent constraint on the pep $\nu$ flux.},

The sites within these (bio)molecules susceptible to oxidation by ROS can thus be {\textquotedblleft}protected {\textquotedblright} using heavier isotopes such as 2H (D, deuterium) and 13C (carbon-13). Ingestion of isotopically reinforced building blocks such as amino acids, lipids and components of nucleic acids and their subsequent incorporation into macromolecules would make these more stable to ROS courtesy of an isotope effect. The implications may include enhanced longevity and increased resistance to cancer and age-related diseases.},

abstract = {In the past ten years, neutrino oscillation experiments have provided the incontrovertible evidence that neutrinos mix and have finite masses. These results represent the strongest demonstration that the electroweak Standard Model is incomplete and that new Physics beyond it must exist. In this scenario, a unique role is played by the Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay searches which can probe lepton number conservation and investigate the Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos and their absolute mass scale (hierarchy problem) with unprecedented sensitivity. Today Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay faces a new era where large-scale experiments with a sensitivity approaching the so-called degenerate-hierarchy region are nearly ready to start and where the challenge for the next future is the construction of detectors characterized by a tonne-scale size and an incredibly low background. A number of new proposed projects took up this challenge. These are based either on large expansions of the present experiments or on new ideas to improve the technical performance and/or reduce the background contributions. In this paper, a review of the most relevant ongoing experiments is given. The most relevant parameters contributing to the experimental sensitivity are discussed and a critical comparison of the future projects is proposed.},

abstract = {The influence of the Earth's magnetic field on large area photomultipliers proposed for a future deep sea neutrino telescope was studied under the EU-funded KM3NeT design study. The aims were to evaluate variations in PMT performance in the Earth's magnetic field and to decide whether the use of magnetic shielding is necessary. Measurements were performed on three Hamamatsu PMTs: two 8-inch R5912 types, one of these with super bialkali photocathode, and a 10-inch R7081 type with a standard bialkali photocathode. The various characteristics of the PMTs were measured while varying the PMT orientations with respect to the Earth's magnetic field, both with and without a mu-metal cage as magnetic shield. In the 8-inch PMTs the impact of the magnetic field was found to be smaller than that on the 10-inch PMT. The increased quantum efficiency in the 8<formula formulatype="inline"> <img src="/images/tex/22075.gif" alt="^{\prime \prime }"> </formula> super bialkali PMT almost compensated its smaller detection surface compared to the 10<formula formulatype="inline"> <img src="/images/tex/22075.gif" alt="^{\prime \prime }"> </formula> PMT.

abstract = {Although amorphous selenium (a-Se) has a long and successful history of application in optical and X-ray imaging, some of its fundamental properties are still puzzling. In particularly, the mechanism of carrier recombination following x-ray excitation and electric field and temperature dependences of the electron-hole pair creation energy (Wehp) remain unclear. Using the combination of X-rayphotocurrent and pulse height spectroscopy measurements, we measure Wehp in a wide range of temperatures (218{\textendash}320 K) and electric fields (10{\textendash}100 V/{\textmu}m) and show that the conventional columnar recombination model which assumes Langevin recombination within a column (a primary electron track) fails to explain experimental results in a wide range of electric fields and temperatures. The reason for the failure of the conventional model is revealed in this work, and the theory of the columnar recombination is modified to include the saturation of the recombination rate at high electric field in order to account for the experimental results in the entire range of fields and temperatures.},

Cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, which severely constrain light symmetric DM, can be evaded if the DM relic density is sufficiently asymmetric. Cosmic microwave background constraints require the present anti-DM-to-DM ratio to be less than $\ensuremath{\sim}2\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}6}$ (${10}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$) for DM mass ${m}_{X}=1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{MeV}$ (10 GeV) with ionizing efficiency factor $f\ensuremath{\sim}1$. We determine the minimum annihilation cross section for achieving these asymmetries subject to the relic density constraint; these cross sections are larger than the usual thermal annihilation cross section. On account of collider constraints, such annihilation cross sections can only be obtained by invoking light mediators. These light mediators can give rise to significant DM self-interactions, and we derive a lower bound on the mediator mass from elliptical DM halo shape constraints. We find that halo shapes require a mediator with mass ${m}_{\ensuremath{\phi}}\ensuremath{\gtrsim}4\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}2}\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{MeV}$ (40 MeV) for ${m}_{X}=1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{MeV}$ (10 GeV). We map all of these constraints to the parameter space of DM-electron and DM-nucleon scattering cross sections for direct detection. For DM-electron scattering, a significant fraction of the parameter space is already ruled out by beam-dump and supernova cooling constraints.},

The amount of electronic excitation produced by such atoms is quenched relative to a recoiling electron of the same energy. The Lindhard model of this quenching, as originally formulated, remains widely used after more than 50 years. The present work shows that for very small energies, a simplifying approximation of that model must be removed. This leads to a kinematic cutoff in the production of electronic excitation. Implications for the sensitivity of direct detection experiments are discussed.},

abstract = {Dead-time losses are well recognized and studied drawbacks in counting and spectroscopic systems. In this work the abilities on dead-time correction of a real-time digital pulse processing (DPP) system for high-rate high-resolution radiation measurements are presented. The DPP system, through a fast and slow analysis of the output waveform from radiation detectors, is able to perform multi-parameter analysis (arrival time, pulse width, pulse height, pulse shape, etc.) at high input counting rates (ICRs), allowing accurate counting loss corrections even for variable or transient radiations. The fast analysis is used to obtain both the ICR and energy spectra with high throughput, while the slow analysis is used to obtain high-resolution energy spectra. A complete characterization of the counting capabilities, through both theoretical and experimental approaches, was performed. The dead-time modeling, the throughput curves, the experimental time-interval distributions (TIDs) and the counting uncertainty of the recorded events of both the fast and the slow channels, measured with a planar CdTe (cadmium telluride) detector, will be presented. The throughput formula of a series of two types of dead-times is also derived. The results of dead-time corrections, performed through different methods, will be reported and discussed, pointing out the error on ICR estimation and the simplicity of the procedure. Accurate ICR estimations (nonlinearity < 0.5%) were performed by using the time widths and the TIDs (using 10 ns time bin width) of the detected pulses up to 2.2 Mcps. The digital system allows, after a simple parameter setting, different and sophisticated procedures for dead-time correction, traditionally implemented in complex/dedicated systems and time-consuming set-ups.},

abstract = {PET is widely considered the most sensitive technique available for noninvasively studying physiology, metabolism, and molecular pathways in the living human being. However, the utility of PET, being a photon-deficient modality, remains constrained by factors including low signal-to-noise ratio, long imaging times, and concerns about radiation dose. Two developments offer the potential to dramatically increase the effective sensitivity of PET. First by increasing the geometric coverage to encompass the entire body, sensitivity can be increased by a factor of about 40 for total-body imaging or a factor of about 4-5 for imaging a single organ such as the brain or heart. The world's first total-body PET/CT scanner is currently under construction to demonstrate how this step change in sensitivity affects the way PET is used both in clinical research and in patient care. Second, there is the future prospect of significant improvements in timing resolution that could lead to further effective sensitivity gains. When combined with total-body PET, this could produce overall sensitivity gains of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with existing state-of-the-art systems. In this article, we discuss the benefits of increasing body coverage, describe our efforts to develop a first-generation total-body PET/CT scanner, discuss selected application areas for total-body PET, and project the impact of further improvements in time-of-flight PET.},

abstract = {Robust results of WIMP direct detection experiments depend on firm understandings of nuclear recoils in the detector media. This thesis documents the most comprehensive study to date on nuclear recoils in liquid argon - a strong candidate for the next generation multi-ton scale WIMP detectors. This study investigates both the energy partition from nuclear recoil energy to secondary modes (scintillation and ionization) and the pulse shape characteristics of scintillation from nuclear recoils.
	Our collaboration, SCENE, acquired the scintillation and ionization signals of recoiling nuclei in liquid argon as a function of applied electric field by exposing a dual-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) to a low energy pulsed narrowband neutron beam produced at the Notre Dame Institute for Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics. I present measurements of the scintillation yield and the scintillation pulse shape for nuclear recoils with energies from 10.3 to 57.2 keV and for applied electric fields from 0 to 1000 V/cm. For the ionization yield, I report measurements from 16.9 to 57.2 keV and for electric fields from 50 to 500 V/cm. I also report the observation of an anti-correlation between scintillation and ionization from nuclear recoils, which is similar to the anti-correlation between scintillation and ionization from electron recoils. With an assumption that the energy partition in excitons and ion pairs of Kr-83m internal conversion electrons is comparable to that of Bi-207 conversion electrons, the numbers of excitons and ion pairs and their ratio produced by nuclear recoils from 16.9 to 57.2 keV are calculated. Motivated by arguments suggesting direction sensitivity in LAr-TPC signals due to columnar recombination, a comparison of the light and charge yield of recoils parallel and perpendicular to the applied electric field is presented for the first time.},

abstract = {Electron antineutrinos are commonly detected in liquid scintillator experiments via inverse $\ensuremath{\beta}$ decay by looking at the coincidence between the reaction products: neutrons and positrons. Prior to positron annihilation, an electron-positron pair may form an orthopositronium (o-Ps) state, with a mean lifetime of a few nanoseconds. Even if the o-Ps decay is speeded up by spin-flip or pick-off effects, it may introduce distortions in the photon emission time distribution, crucial for position reconstruction and pulse shape discrimination algorithms in antineutrino experiments. Reversing the problem, the o-Ps-induced time distortion represents a new signature for tagging antineutrinos in liquid scintillator. In this article, we report the results of measurements of the o-Ps formation probability and lifetime for the most used solvents for organic liquid scintillators in neutrino physics (pseudocumene, linear alkyl benzene, phenylxylylethane, and dodecane). We characterize also a mixture of pseudocumene $+$1.5 g/l of 2,5-diphenyloxazole, a fluor acting as wavelength shifter. In the second part of the article, we demonstrate that the o-Ps-induced distortion of the scintillation photon emission time distributions represent an optimal signature for tagging positrons on an event by event basis, potentially enhancing the antineutrino detection.},

abstract = {The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment will search for dark matter particle interactions with a detector containing a total of 10 tonnes of liquid xenon within a double-vessel cryostat. The large mass and proximity of the cryostat to the active detector volume demand the use of material with extremely low intrinsic radioactivity. We report on the radioassay campaign conducted to identify suitable metals, the determination of factors limiting radiopure production, and the selection of titanium for construction of the LZ cryostat and other detector components. This titanium has been measured with activities of 238Ue{\textasciitilde}<1.6{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, 238Ul{\textasciitilde}<0.09{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, 232The{\textasciitilde}=0.28 0.03{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, 232Thl{\textasciitilde}=0.25 0.02{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, 40K{\textasciitilde}<0.54{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg, and 60Co{\textasciitilde}<0.02{\textasciitilde}mBq/kg (68% CL). Such low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for titanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background contribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of WIMP search exposure of a 5.6-tonne fiducial mass, the cryostat will contribute only a mean background of 0.1600.001(stat)0.030(sys) counts.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the extraction efficiency of quasi-free electrons from the liquid into the gas phase in a two-phase xenon time-projection chamber. The measurements span a range of electric fields from 2.4 to 7.1 kV/cm in the liquid xenon, corresponding to 4.5 to 13.1 kV/cm in the gaseous xenon. Extraction efficiency continues to increase at the highest extraction fields, implying that additional charge signal may be attained in two-phase xenon detectors through careful high-voltage engineering of the gate-anode region.},

abstract = {CoGeNT employs $p$-type point-contact (PPC) germanium detectors to search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). By virtue of its low-energy threshold and ability to reject surface backgrounds, this type of device allows an emphasis on low-mass dark matter candidates (${m}_{\ensuremath{\chi}}\ensuremath{\sim}10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$). We report on the characteristics of the PPC detector presently taking data at the Soudan Underground Laboratory, elaborating on aspects of shielding, data acquisition, instrumental stability, data analysis, and background estimation. A detailed background model is used to investigate the low-energy excess of events previously reported and to assess the possibility of temporal modulations in the low-energy event rate. Extensive simulations of all presently known backgrounds do not provide a viable background explanation for the excess of low-energy events in the CoGeNT data or the previously observed temporal variation in the event rate. Also reported for the first time is a determination of the surface (slow pulse rise time) event contamination in the data as a function of energy. We conclude that the CoGeNT detector technology is well suited to search for the annual modulation signature expected from dark matter particle interactions in the region of WIMP mass and coupling favored by the DAMA/LIBRA results.},

The agreement between the predicted and observed abundances of deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7 confirms the standard cosmology model and allows accurate determination of the baryon density, between 1.7 x 10(-31) and 4.1 x 10(-31) grams per cubic centimeter (corresponding to about 1 to 15 percent of the critical density). This measurement of the density of ordinary matter is pivotal to the establishment of two dark-matter problems: (i) most of the baryons are dark, and (ii) if the total mass density is greater than about 15 percent of the critical density, as many determinations indicate, the bulk of the dark matter must be "non-baryonic," composed of elementary particles left from the earliest moments.},

abstract = {On August 17, 2017 the LIGO interferometers detected the gravitational wave (GW) signal (GW170817) from the coalescence of binary neutron stars. This signal was also simultaneously seen throughout the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays. We point out that this simultaneous detection of GW and EM signals rules out a class of modified gravity theories, termed ``dark matter emulators,'' which dispense with the need for dark matter by making ordinary matter couple to a different metric from that of GW. We discuss other kinds of modified gravity theories which dispense with the need for dark matter and are still viable. This simultaneous observation also provides the first observational test of Einstein's weak equivalence principle (WEP) between gravitons and photons. We estimate the Shapiro time delay due to the gravitational potential of the total dark matter distribution along the line of sight (complementary to the calculation by Abbott et al. [Astrophys. J. Lett. 848, L13 (2017)]) to be about 400 days. Using this estimate for the Shapiro delay and from the time difference of 1.7 seconds between the GW signal and gamma rays, we can constrain violations of the WEP using the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\ensuremath{\gamma}$, and it is given by $|{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{\mathrm{GW}}\ensuremath{-}{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{\mathrm{EM}}|{\&}lt;9.8\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}8}$.},

abstract = {In this study, an efficient method for using pulsed plasma to produce hydrogen from ammonia was developed. An original pulsed plasma reactor with a hydrogen separation membrane was developed for efficient hydrogen production, and its hydrogen production performance was investigated. Hydrogen production in the plasma was affected by the applied voltage and flow rate of ammonia gas. The maximum hydrogen production flow rate of a typical plasma reactor was 8.7 L/h, whereas that of the plasma membrane reactor was 21.0 L/h. We found that ammonia recombination reactions in the plasma controlled hydrogen production in the plasma reactor. In the plasma membrane reactor, a significant increase in hydrogen production was obtained because ammonia recombination reactions were inhibited by the permeation of hydrogen radicals generated in the plasma through a palladium alloy membrane. The energy efficiency was 4.42 mol-H2/kWh depending on the discharge power.},

abstract = {We propose to achieve the proof-of-principle of the PTOLEMY project to directly detect the Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB). Each of the technological challenges described in [1,2] will be targeted and hopefully solved by the use of the latest experimental developments and profiting from the low background environment provided by the LNGS underground site. The first phase will focus on the graphene technology for a tritium target and the demonstration of TES microcalorimetry with an energy resolution of better than 0.05 eV for low energy electrons. These technologies will be evaluated using the PTOLEMY prototype, proposed for underground installation, using precision HV controls to step down the kinematic energy of endpoint electrons to match the calorimeter dynamic range and rate capabilities. The second phase will produce a novel implementation of the EM filter that is scalable to the full target size and which demonstrates intrinsic triggering capability for selecting endpoint electrons. Concurrent with the CNB program, we plan to exploit and develop the unique properties of graphene to implement an intermediate program for direct directional detection of MeV dark matter [3,4]. This program will evaluate the radio-purity and scalability of the graphene fabrication process with the goal of using recently identified ultra-high radio-purity CO2 sources. The direct detection of the CNB is a snapshot of early universe dynamics recorded by the thermal relic neutrino yield taken at a time that predates the epochs of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background and the recession of galaxies (Hubble Expansion). Big Bang neutrinos are believed to have a central role in the evolution of the Universe and a direct measurement with PTOLEMY will unequivocally establish the extent to which these predictions match present-day neutrino densities.},

abstract = {One of the next frontiers in dark-matter direct-detection experiments is to explore the MeV to GeV mass regime. Such light dark matter does not carry enough kinetic energy to produce an observable nuclear recoil, but it can scatter off electrons, leading to a measurable signal. We introduce a semi-analytic approach to characterize the resulting electron-scattering events in atomic and semiconductor targets, improving on previous analytic proposals that underestimate the signal at high recoil energies. We then use this procedure to study the time-dependent properties of the electron-scattering signal, including the modulation fraction, higher-harmonic modes and modulation phase. The time dependence can be distinct in a non-trivial way from the nuclear scattering case. Additionally, we show that dark-matter interactions inside the Earth can significantly distort the lab-frame phase-space distribution of sub-GeV dark matter.

abstract = {CDMS II data from the five-tower runs at the Soudan Underground Laboratory were reprocessed with an improved charge-pulse fitting algorithm. Two new analysis techniques to reject surface-event backgrounds were applied to the 612 kg days germanium-detector weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-search exposure. An extended analysis was also completed by decreasing the 10 keV analysis threshold to $\ensuremath{\sim}5\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{keV}$, to increase sensitivity near a WIMP mass of $8\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$. After unblinding, there were zero candidate events above a deposited energy of 10 keV and six events in the lower-threshold analysis. This yielded minimum WIMP-nucleon spin-independent scattering cross-section limits of $1.8\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}44}$ and $1.18\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}41}$ at 90% confidence for 60 and $8.6\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ WIMPs, respectively. This improves the previous CDMS II result by a factor of 2.4 (2.7) for 60 $(8.6)\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ WIMPs.},

Three dark matter candidates were found between 25 keV and 150 keV. The probability to observe three or more background events in this energy range is 11%. Because of the occurrence of these events, the constraints on the iDM parameter space are slightly less stringent than those from our previous analysis, which used an energy window of 10\char21{}100 keV.},

abstract = {We propose two distinct atom interferometer gravitational wave detectors, one terrestrial and another satellite based, utilizing the core technology of the Stanford 10 m atom interferometer presently under construction. Each configuration compares two widely separated atom interferometers run using common lasers. The signal scales with the distance between the interferometers, which can be large since only the light travels over this distance, not the atoms. The terrestrial experiment with two $\ensuremath{\sim}10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{m}$ atom interferometers separated by a $\ensuremath{\sim}1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{km}$ baseline can operate with strain sensitivity $\ensuremath{\sim}\frac{{10}^{\ensuremath{-}19}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ in the 1 Hz\char21{}10 Hz band, inaccessible to LIGO, and can detect gravitational waves from solar mass binaries out to megaparsec distances. The satellite experiment with two atom interferometers separated by a $\ensuremath{\sim}1000\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{km}$ baseline can probe the same frequency spectrum as LISA with comparable strain sensitivity $\ensuremath{\sim}\frac{{10}^{\ensuremath{-}20}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$. The use of ballistic atoms (instead of mirrors) as inertial test masses improves systematics coming from vibrations and acceleration noise, and significantly reduces spacecraft control requirements. We analyze the backgrounds in this configuration and discuss methods for controlling them to the required levels.},

In this study, we have characterized the three existing series of low-lying Rydberg states of CH4 by computing coupled cluster linear response (CCLR) vertical excitation energies together with oscillator strengths in the molecular-adapted quantum defect orbital formalism from a distorted Cs geometry selected on the basis of outer valence green function calculations. The present work provides a wide range of data of excitation energies and absolute oscillator strengths which correspond to the Rydberg series converging to the three lower ionization potential values of the distorted methane molecule, in energy regions for which experimentally measured data appear to be unavailable.},

abstract = {This Letter reports the first results of a direct dark matter search with the DEAP-3600 single-phase liquid argon (LAr) detector. The experiment was performed 2 km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada) utilizing a large target mass, with the LAr target contained in a spherical acrylic vessel of 3600 kg capacity. The LAr is viewed by an array of PMTs, which would register scintillation light produced by rare nuclear recoil signals induced by dark matter particle scattering. An analysis of 4.44 live days (fiducial exposure of 9.87 ton day) of data taken during the initial filling phase demonstrates the best electronic recoil rejection using pulse-shape discrimination in argon, with leakage ${\&}lt;1.2\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}7}$ (90% C.L.) between 15 and $31\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{keV}}_{ee}$. No candidate signal events are observed, which results in the leading limit on weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-nucleon spin-independent cross section on argon, ${\&}lt;1.2\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}44}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ for a $100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ WIMP mass (90% C.L.).},

abstract = {<p>As the first stars heated hydrogen in the early Universe, the 21-cm hyperfine line{\textemdash}an astronomical standard that represents the spin-flip transition in the ground state of atomic hydrogen{\textemdash}was altered, causing the hydrogen gas to absorb photons from the microwave background. This should produce an observable absorption signal at frequencies of less than 200 megahertz (MHz). Judd Bowman and colleagues report the observation of an absorption profile centred at a frequency of 78 MHz that is about 19 MHz wide and 0.5 kelvin deep. The profile is generally in line with expectations, although it is deeper than predicted. An accompanying paper by Rennan Barkana suggests that baryons were interacting with cold dark-matter particles in the early Universe, cooling the gas more than had been expected.</p>},

Significant but realistic new efforts would be required. With an exposure of 100 kton-year, DUNE could detect  105 signal events above 5 MeV. Separate precision measurements of neutrino-mixing parameters and the 8B flux could be made using two detection channels ($\nu$e + \, 40Ar and $\nu$e,$\mu$,$\tau$ + e^-) and the day-night effect (> 10 $\sigma$). New particle physics may be revealed through the comparison of solar neutrinos (with matter effects) and reactor neutrinos (without), which is discrepant by  2 $\sigma$ (and could become 5.6 $\sigma$). New astrophysics may be revealed through the most precise measurement of the 8B flux (to 2.5\%) and the first detection of the hep flux (to 11\%). DUNE is required: No other experiment, even proposed, has been shown capable of fully realizing these discovery opportunities.},

With a 5 MCi source placed at {\textasciitilde} 25 cm from the detector, under an exposure of two 51Cr half-lives (55.4 days), we evaluate 3900 (900) counts on a 2 dm3 target of germanium (sapphire) featuring an energy threshold of 8 (20) eV.

abstract = {Single photon avalanche diodes(SPADs) are avalanche photodiodes specifically designed for reverse bias operation above the breakdown voltage and used for detecting single optical photons. A new siliconepitaxial device structure was designed to give improved timing performance with respect to previous SPADs. Extensive tests were carried out in order to establish the timing resolution of the device in time correlated photon counting (TCPC). The timing resolution of the SPAD in terms of its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) contribution to the overall instrumental response width is 20 ps with the detector cooled to {\textminus}65 {\textdegree}C, and 28 ps at room temperature. This is the highest resolution so far reported for solid-state single-photon detectors. In vacuum tubes, comparable results are obtained only with special microchannel-plate photomultipliers (MCP-PMT). Results from time-resolved photoluminescencemeasurements in GaAs demonstrate the power of the TCPC technique when used with the new SPAD detector. With the excellent timing resolution of the SPAD and the well-known advantages of TCPC systems (high sensitivity, linearity, etc.), various applications are foreseen in areas so far dominated by streak cameras.},

abstract = {A pressure-swing adsorption process, which uses zeolite 13X as an adsorbent to recover and sequester carbon dioxide from mixture gas (nitrogen and carbon dioxide), is investigated through dynamic simulation and optimization. The purpose of this paper is to improve the purity of each component by finding optimal values of decision variables with a given power constraint. Langmuir isotherm parameters are calculated from experimental data of zeolite 13X and a general mathematical model consisting of a set of partial differential and algebraic equations and solved in gPROMS. The method of centered finite differences is adopted for the discretization of the spatial domains, and a reduced space SQP method is used for the optimization. As a result, the optimal conditions at cyclic steady state are obtained.},

However, such experiments are becoming increasingly difficult and costly due to the large target masses and exquisite background rejection needed for the necessary improvements in sensitivity. We investigate an alternative approach to the detection of Dark Matter--nucleon interactions: Searching for the persistent traces left by Dark Matter scattering in ancient minerals obtained from much deeper than current underground laboratories. We estimate the sensitivity of paleo-detectors, which extends far beyond current upper limits for a wide range of Dark Matter masses.},

abstract = {The time dependence of luminescence in liquid argon and xenon has been studied for electron, $\ensuremath{\alpha}$-particle, and fission-fragment excitation. The lifetimes of low excited molecular states ($^{1}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$ and $^{3}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$) do not depend on the density of excited species while the intensity ratio of $^{1}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$ to $^{3}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$ is found to be larger at higher deposited energy density. The lifetimes obtained for the $^{1}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$ and $^{3}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$ states are 7.0 \ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{} 1.0 nsec and 1.6 \ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{} 0.1 \ensuremath{\mu}sec, respectively, in liquid argon, and 4.3 \ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{} 0.6 and 22.0 \ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{} 2.0 nsec, respectively, in liquid xenon. The mechanism of quenching of luminescence at a high density of excited species in liquid argon and xenon is discussed.},

The rate of capture is exponentially enhanced when such particles have self-interactions of the right order to explain structure formation on galactic scales. A ``dark baryon'' of mass 5 GeV is a natural candidate and has the required relic abundance if its asymmetry is similar to that of ordinary baryons. We show that such particles can solve the ``solar composition problem.'' The predicted small decrease in the low energy neutrino fluxes may be measurable by the Borexino and ${\mathrm{SNO}}^{+}$ experiments.},

abstract = {The behavior of a star with a thermonuclear energy source consistent with our present knowledge about nuclear reactions is studied in relation to the problems of stellar evolution and interpretation of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and mass-luminosity relation. It is found that in the case of ordinary thermonuclear reactions, with the absence of selective temperature effects (nuclear resonance) the central temperature and luminosity of the star (with constant mass) will rapidly increase in the process of evolution. If, however, such selective effects are present, the energy-production at the center of the star will cease, beginning with the stage when the central temperature reaches the selective value, and energy will be produced only in a spherical shell around the center. This shell will have exactly the selective temperature value corresponding to the thermonuclear reaction in question, and its radius will slowly increase in the process of evolution causing a very slow increase of luminosity. Finally, in the third stage of evolution, when all hydrogen necessary for thermonuclear reactions has been consumed, the star will start a rapid contraction and, passing through the high density stage, will end its life as a cool body. It is also indicated that the star model with a shell source does not possess the property of "super-stability" characteristic for the point-source models.},

WIMP interactions with sensitive detectors are expected to display a characteristic annual modulation in rate. We release a dataset spanning 3.4 years of operation from a low-background germanium detector, designed to search for this signature. A previously reported modulation persists, concentrated in a region of the energy spectrum populated by an exponential excess of unknown origin. Its phase and period agree with phenomenological expectations, but its amplitude is a factor 4-7 larger than predicted for a standard WIMP galactic halo. We consider the possibility of a non-Maxwellian local halo velocity distribution as a plausible explanation, able to help reconcile recently reported WIMP search anomalies.},

abstract = {Calculations of the pair-creation energy $\ensuremath{\epsilon}$, the Fano factor $F$, and the quantum yield for semiconductors are done for the assumptions that in each scattering event all possible sets of product particles are equally probable, that the energy bands are those of free particles separated by a band gap ${E}_{g}$, and that there is a single phonon energy $\ensuremath{\hbar}{\ensuremath{\omega}}_{0}$. A new method of calculating these quantities is advanced. In it a pair-number probability distribution ${p}_{n}(E)$, the probability that a particle with energy $E$ ultimately creates $n$ pairs, is calculated recursively with increasing $E$. The first and second moments of the ${p}_{n}(E)$ distribution yield $\ensuremath{\epsilon}$, $F$, and the quantum yield as functions of $\ensuremath{\hbar}{\ensuremath{\omega}}_{0}$, ${E}_{g}$, and a parameter $A$, proportional to the ratio of the matrix elements for electron scattering by phonon emission and by ionization. We find that a single value of $A$, which fits the $\ensuremath{\epsilon}$ observed for Si, gives values for these quantities in good accord with experiments for many semiconductors. The calculated $\ensuremath{\epsilon}$ is found insensitive in many semiconductors to electron-energy loss to plasmons and to differences in the threshold energy for ionization representing real band-structure features. The assumption that all possible sets of product particles are equally probable in each scattering event leads to ultimate nonuniform population of the states with energies below the threshold for ionization, in contrast to the uniform population assumed in some earlier approaches. Results of other existing approaches in which the final-state distribution is calculated, an alternate method, were duplicated using this new method. A simple paradigm is used to illustrate these methods and assumptions.},

The most relevant quantity obtained in this way is the average of the Laplacian of the potential energy of the system, 〈∇ 2 U〉, also known as the mean force constant. The results correctly predict the different rare-gas VPIEs which span over several orders of magnitude. Using a simple two-parameter corresponding states principle, the method is capable of predicting VPIEs simply from the knowledge of isotopically independent Lennard-Jones parameters of each rare gas and the masses of its isotopes. Each type of VPIE (in pure isotopes or mixtures) map onto two reduced variable equations in terms of ln (f 1 /f g o ) * and ln ($\gamma$ $\infty$ ) * . The former quantity represents a reduced form of the reduced partition function ratio (a measure of the VPIE between pure isotopes) while the second is a reduced form of the liquid activity coefficient at infinite dilution (a measure of VPIEs in isotopic binary mixtures). Several issues related to the temperature and density dependence of 〈∇ 2 U〉 are also addressed in this work.},

We study the GeV excess using 6.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We characterize the uncertainty of the GC excess spectrum and morphology due to uncertainties in cosmic-ray source distributions and propagation, uncertainties in the distribution of interstellar gas in the Milky Way, and uncertainties due to a potential contribution from the Fermi bubbles. We also evaluate uncertainties in the excess properties due to resolved point sources of gamma rays. The Galactic center is of particular interest as it would be expected to have the brightest signal from annihilation of weakly interacting massive dark matter particles. However, control regions along the Galactic plane, where a dark-matter signal is not expected, show excesses of similar amplitude relative to the local background. Based on the magnitude of the systematic uncertainties, we conservatively report upper limits for the annihilation cross section as function of particle mass and annihilation channel.},

Experimental methods allowing an accurate measurement of these four quantities are described. The new concept of an extrapolated breakdown voltage Vb is discussed based on two independent measurements: one of secondary multiplication and the other of instantaneous current, both as a function of voltage. Within the experimental accuracy of 20 mV both methods extrapolated to one and the same breakdown voltage. The turnoff probability p 10(I) is determined by a new combination of experimental techniques to cover the current range from 5 to 70 $\mu$A with a variation of 11 decades for p 10(I). The observation of a narrow turnoff interval is explained quantitatively.},

The magnitude of the increase in the adsorption capacities for nitrogen is much higher than that of oxygen. The nitrogen/oxygen as well as nitrogen/argon selectivities in the low-pressure region increase with an increase in cobalt exchange.

abstract = {There has been accumulating evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe, but its nature remains a deep mystery. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are likely dark matter candidates, which may scatter with nuclei and get detected. Several experiments have been launched in attempts to detect WIMP-induced nuclear recoils, but no conclusive detection has been confirmed. Now it is generally believed that ton-scale detectors are required for sensitive WIMP detection, and this may go beyond the reach of traditional low background technologies. Detectors using noble liquids such as argon offer this desired scalability, and argon has also been shown to have excellent background rejection power from scintillation pulse shape analysis. The problem with argon, however, lies in the cosmogenic <super>39</super>Ar isotope in atmospheric argon; it restricts the ultimate size of argon Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) and also reduces the detectors' WIMP sensitivity. 								 The DarkSide collaboration has successfully located underground sources of argon with extremely low <super>39</super>Ar levels that are below the sensitivity of all known measurement techniques. Therefore, we developed a low background liquid argon detector to measure the <super>39</super>Ar concentration in this underground argon. The detector was constructed with radio-clean materials and was carefully shielded from backgrounds. Using the data acquired in an underground laboratory (1450 m.w.e.) combined with Monte Carlo techniques, we obtained an <super>39</super>Ar limit in samples of underground argon at 0.65% of the concentration in atmospheric argon, 10 times better than the previously best result. This measurement demonstrates the possibility of achieving ultra-low background levels in argon-based detectors, and may extend the mass limit of argon TPCs by 45 times. Multi-ton detectors using underground argon are expected to cover a large fraction of the WIMP parameter space predicted by popular WIMP theories. I also discuss the possible application of the underground argon in the detection of low mass WIMP interactions and coherent neutrino scattering.},

abstract = {The Borexino Solar Neutrino Experiment will observe the monoenergetic (862keV) 7Be neutrinos, produced in the solar reaction 7Be+e{\textminus} {\textrightarrow}7 Li+$\nu$e. These neutrinos are the second most abundant species of solar neutrinos, with an expected flux at earth of 5 {\texttimes} 109/cm2/s. Using $\nu$ {\textminus} e scattering in an aromatic liquid scintillator, Borexino will make the first real time measurement of the solar neutrino flux at energies less than 1 MeV.
In addition to checking Standard Solar Model and neutrino oscillation predictions at low energies, Borexino will test the MSW vacuum-matter transition, luminosity constraint, and non-standard theories such as mass varying neutrinos. The Borexino detector will also be sensitive to supernova neutrinos, geoneutrinos, reactor neutrinos, and pep solar neutrinos. The pep measurement will tightly constrain the primary pp solar neutrino flux whose energy is below the Borexino threshold.
With an expected rate of 35 events per day from solar 7Be neutrinos, the maximum tolerable background rate is one count per day. Removal of radioactive isotopes from the liquid scintillator is essential for the experiment{\textquoteright}s success and will be achieved with purification techniques including filtration, distillation, water extraction, nitrogen stripping, and silica gel adsorption. Results from small-scale purification efficiency tests are presented. Water extraction showed moderate but inadequate removal of 210Po which is a dominant background. Distillation reduced 210Po by a factor of more than 500.
Online purification involves cycling over 300 m3 of scintillator from the detector though the purification plants. Flow patterns within the detector that influence the purification efficiency were determined with numerical simulations. Poor flow in the prototype Counting Test Facility showed effectively stagnant volumes within the detector. These are not present in the larger Borexino detector.
Surface contamination in Borexino arises primarily from contact with contaminated liquids and the deposition of airborne radon progeny. Measurements of desorption rates showed that surface contaminants are transferred to the scintillator logarithmically with time. Partitioning constants between the scintillator and surfaces were measured and air- borne deposition rate of radon progeny in a clean room environment are analyzed. The efficiency of various surface cleaning techniques was also tested.},

abstract = {SuperCDMS is an experiment designed to directly detect weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a favored candidate for dark matter ubiquitous in the Universe. In this Letter, we present WIMP-search results using a calorimetric technique we call CDMSlite, which relies on voltage-assisted Luke-Neganov amplification of the ionization energy deposited by particle interactions. The data were collected with a single 0.6 kg germanium detector running for ten live days at the Soudan Underground Laboratory. A low energy threshold of $170\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{eV}}_{\mathrm{ee}}$ (electron equivalent) was obtained, which allows us to constrain new WIMP-nucleon spin-independent parameter space for WIMP masses below $6\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$.},

abstract = {Interference with atomic and molecular matter waves is a rich branch of atomic physics and quantum optics. It started with atom diffraction from crystal surfaces and the separated oscillatory fields technique used in atomic clocks. Atom interferometry is now reaching maturity as a powerful art with many applications in modern science. In this review the basic tools for coherent atom optics are described including diffraction by nanostructures and laser light, three-grating interferometers, and double wells on atom chips. Scientific advances in a broad range of fields that have resulted from the application of atom interferometers are reviewed. These are grouped in three categories: (i) fundamental quantum science, (ii) precision metrology, and (iii) atomic and molecular physics. Although some experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates are included, the focus of the review is on linear matter wave optics, i.e., phenomena where each single atom interferes with itself.},

abstract = {A liquid argon time projection chamber, constructed for the Argon Response to Ionization and Scintillation (ARIS) experiment, is exposed to the highly collimated and quasimonoenergetic LICORNE neutron beam at the Institut de Physique Nucl\'eaire d'Orsay (IPNO) in order to study the scintillation response to nuclear and electronic recoils. An array of liquid scintillator detectors, arranged around the apparatus, tag scattered neutrons and select nuclear recoil energies in the [7, 120] keV energy range. The relative scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils is measured to high precision at null field, and the ion-electron recombination probability is extracted for a range of applied electric fields. Single-scattered Compton electrons, produced by gammas emitted from the deexcitation of $^{7}{\mathrm{Li}}^{*}$ in coincidence with the beam pulse, along with calibration gamma sources, are used to extract the recombination probability as a function of energy and electron drift field. The ARIS results are compared with three recombination probability parametrizations (Thomas-Imel, Doke-Birks, and PARIS), allowing for the definition of a fully comprehensive model of the liquid argon response to nuclear and electronic recoils down to the few-keV range. The constraints provided by ARIS to the liquid argon response at low energy allow the reduction of systematics affecting the sensitivity of dark matter search experiments based on liquid argon.},

abstract = {The CDEX-1 experiment conducted a search of low-mass (${\&}lt;10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$) weakly interacting massive particles dark matter at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory using a p-type point-contact germanium detector with a fiducial mass of 915 g at a physics analysis threshold of 475 eVee. We report the hardware setup, detector characterization, data acquisition, and analysis procedures of this experiment. No excess of unidentified events is observed after the subtraction of the known background. Using 335.6 kg-days of data, exclusion constraints on the weakly interacting massive particle-nucleon spin-independent and spin-dependent couplings are derived.},

abstract = {Avalanchep{\textendash}nphotodiodes with uniform breakdown over the junction area are known to be capable of single-photon detection. An experimental study has been performed on the temporal resolution of these single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) in measurements of the shape of ultrashort light pulses. By using an active-quenching circuit, pulsed operation of the device has been obtained in accurately controlled conditions, avoiding spurious effects met in previous passive-quenching circuits. Laser pulses with durations down to 150 ps FWHM have been used; the results obtained show that the resolution is remarkably better than this value. Performances and limitations of SPADs are discussed; temporal resolutions of a few tens of picoseconds may be expected.},

abstract = {The identity of dark matter is a question of central importance in both astrophysics and particle physics. In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. I then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, I critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, ...},

abstract = {CdZnTe detectors have been under development for the past two decades, providing good stopping power for gamma rays, lightweight camera heads and improved energy resolution. However, the performance of this type of detector is limited primarily by incomplete charge collection problems resulting from charge carriers trapping. This paper is a review of the progress in the development of CdZnTe unipolar detectors with some data correction techniques for improving performance of the detectors. We will first briefly review the relevant theories. Thereafter, two aspects of the techniques for overcoming the hole trapping issue are summarized, including irradiation direction configuration and pulse shape correction methods. CdZnTe detectors of different geometries are discussed in detail, covering the principal of the electrode geometry design, the design and performance characteristics, some detector prototypes development and special correction techniques to improve the energy resolution. Finally, the state of art development of 3-D position sensing and Compton imaging technique are also discussed. Spectroscopic performance of CdZnTe semiconductor detector will be greatly improved even to approach the statistical limit on energy resolution with the combination of some of these techniques.},

abstract = {The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) operating at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. A calibration of nuclear recoils in liquid xenon was performed in situ in the LUX detector using a collimated beam of mono-energetic 2.45 MeV neutrons produced by a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion source. The nuclear recoil energy from the first neutron scatter in the TPC was reconstructed using the measured scattering angle defined by double-scatter neutron events within the active xenon volume. We measured the absolute charge (Qy) and light (Ly) yields at an average electric field of 180 V/cm for nuclear recoil energies spanning 0.7 to 74 keV and 1.1 to 74 keV, respectively. This calibration of the nuclear recoil signal yields will permit the further refinement of liquid xenon nuclear recoil signal models and, importantly for dark matter searches, clearly demonstrates measured ionization and scintillation signals in this medium at recoil energies down to O(1 keV).},

In this Letter, we present first dark matter results from the analysis of 11.17 live days of nonblind data, acquired in October and November 2009. In the selected fiducial target of 40 kg, and within the predefined signal region, we observe no events and hence exclude spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections above $3.4\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}44}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ for $55\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ WIMPs at 90% confidence level. Below $20\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$, this result constrains the interpretation of the CoGeNT and DAMA signals as being due to spin-independent, elastic, light mass WIMP interactions.},

It is under construction in the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc in Spain, and it will begin operations in 2015. The NEXT detector concept provides an energy resolution better than 1% FWHM and a topological signal that can be used to reduce the background. Furthermore, the NEXT technology can be extrapolated to a 1-ton scale experiment.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the electrical characterization of the first prototypes of Geiger-Mode Avalanche Photodiodes (GM-APDs) and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) produced at ITC-irst, Trento. Both static and functional measurements have been performed in dark condition. The static tests, consisting in reverse and forward IV measurements, have been performed on 20GM-APDs and 90 SiPMs. The breakdown voltage, the quenching resistance value and the current level have been proved to be very uniform. On the other hand, the analysis of the dark signals allowed the extraction of important properties such as the dark count rate, the gain, the after-pulse and optical cross-talk (in case of the SiPMs) rates. These parameters have been evaluated as a function of the bias voltage, showing trends perfectly compatible with the theory of the device},

abstract = {We have measured the scintillation and ionization yield of recoiling nuclei in liquid argon as a function of applied electric field by exposing a dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr-TPC) to a low energy pulsed narrow band neutron beam produced at the Notre Dame Institute for Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics. Liquid scintillation counters were arranged to detect and identify neutrons scattered in the TPC and to select the energy of the recoiling nuclei. We report measurements of the scintillation yields for nuclear recoils with energies from 10.3 to 57.3 keV and for median applied electric fields from 0 to $970\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{cm}$. For the ionization yields, we report measurements from 16.9 to 57.3 keV and for electric fields from 96.4 to $486\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{cm}$. We also report the observation of an anticorrelation between scintillation and ionization from nuclear recoils, which is similar to the anticorrelation between scintillation and ionization from electron recoils. Assuming that the energy loss partitions into excitons and ion pairs from $^{83m}\mathrm{Kr}$ internal conversion electrons is comparable to that from $^{207}\mathrm{Bi}$ conversion electrons, we obtained the numbers of excitons (${N}_{\text{ex}}$) and ion pairs (${N}_{\mathrm{i}}$) and their ratio (${N}_{\text{ex}}/{N}_{\mathrm{i}}$) produced by nuclear recoils from 16.9 to 57.3 keV. Motivated by arguments suggesting direction sensitivity in LAr-TPC signals due to columnar recombination, a comparison of the light and charge yield of recoils parallel and perpendicular to the applied electric field is presented for the first time.},

The calibration data is taken with 252Cf radioactive source. Observed scintillation (S1) and electroluminescence (S2) spectra are simultaneously fit with spectra derived from Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulation and an NR model. The scintillation efficiency extracted from the fit is reported as a function of recoil energy and electric field. This result can be used for designing the detector and for the interpretation of experimental data in searching for scintillation and ionization signals induced by WIMP dark matter.},

abstract = {Performance tests on lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO)-based PET scanners cannot be conducted strictly according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) NU 2 standards because of the presence of intrinsic radioactivity within the LSO crystal scintillator material. This background radiation gives rise mainly to random coincidence events but also to a small number of true coincidences, which cannot be eliminated from measurements on such scanners and must therefore be corrected for in the data analysis. The current NU 2 standards do not take account of these backgrounds and hence can lead to erroneous results on LSO-based machines. Nevertheless, the intent of the standards can be met with appropriate modifications to the acquisition and processing procedures. In this paper, we propose certain changes to the NEMA specifications to accommodate this class of scanners. These changes affect mainly the estimation of sensitivity, scatter, randoms, and count losses. Using these modified procedures, the NU 2 performance of LSO-based systems can accurately be measured.},

The first group of isotopes must have $\ensuremath{\gamma}$-rays with energy higher than 2.18 Mev, and the second group must have $\ensuremath{\gamma}$-rays greater than 1.63 Mev but less than 2.18 Mev. No photo-neutrons were observed from ${\mathrm{Co}}^{60}$, ${\mathrm{Cu}}^{64}$, Ag (225 day \textonehalf{}-life), ${\mathrm{Pr}}^{142}$, ${\mathrm{Eu}}^{151}$, ${\mathrm{Dy}}^{165}$, ${\mathrm{Ta}}^{182}$, ${\mathrm{Re}}^{188}$, Ir (19 hours \textonehalf{}-life), and ${\mathrm{Au}}^{198}$ in Be; the intense $\ensuremath{\gamma}$-rays from these isotopes must have energies less than 1.63 Mev. In a second experiment the energy of the photo-neutrons from nine of these sources was determined by measuring the hydrogen scattering cross section of the emitted neutrons. Seven, of the sources seem to emit homogeneous groups of neutrons; they are: Sb+Be, Ga+${\mathrm{D}}_{2}$O, La+${\mathrm{D}}_{2}$O, Mn+${\mathrm{D}}_{2}$O, Na+${\mathrm{D}}_{2}$O, La+Be, and Na+Be with neutron energies 0.024, 0.13, 0.13, 0.22, 0.22, 0.62, and 0.83 Mev, respectively, for the particular sized sources studied. Mn+Be emits three groups of neutrons of different energies, but more than 80 percent of the neutrons seem to be in a group at 0.14 Mev. The energy of the $\ensuremath{\gamma}$-rays calculated to produce neutrons of these energies are: for ${\mathrm{Na}}^{24}$, 2.74 Mev; for ${\mathrm{Mn}}^{56}$, 1.81 and 2.7 Mev (a third $\ensuremath{\gamma}$-ray is present); for ${\mathrm{Ga}}^{72}$, 2.50 Mev (at least one other $\ensuremath{\gamma}$-ray is present with an energy between 2.2 and 1.63 Mev); for ${\mathrm{Sb}}^{124}$, 1.67 Mev; and for ${\mathrm{La}}^{140}$, 2.49 Mev. The total neutron cross section of carbon is also given for seven of these photo-neutron sources.},

The diagram shows a miscibility gap with a critical point for unmixing at 35% methane and 63{\textdegree}K, whereas published liquidus and solidus lines indicate a eutectic point at 39% methane and 71{\textdegree}K. Calculation of the interaction energy of the mixture from the properties of the constituents using the simplest forms of solution theory yields values which deviate by an order of magnitude from those derived from the experimental data. The discrepancy is in part due to an appreciable contribution to the excess free energy from strain energy and otherwise due to inadequacies of the methods of calculating both interaction and strain energies and due to imprecision in the experimental parameters required for these calculations.},

Due to the large dark matter fluxes admitted, these detectors could find dark matter with masses up to 1021 GeV, surpassing the mass sensitivity of current direct detection experiments (such as XENON1T and PICO) by over two orders of magnitude. We derive the spin-independent and spin-dependent cross section sensitivity of these detectors using existing selection triggers, and propose an improved trigger program that enhances this sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. We interpret these sensitivities in terms of three dark matter scenarios: (1) effective contact operators for scattering, (2) QCD-charged dark matter, and (3) a recently proposed model of Planck-mass baryon-charged dark matter. We calculate the flux attenuation of dark matter at these detectors due to the earth overburden, taking into account the earth's density profile and elemental composition, and nuclear spins.},

Detectors located downstream of an intense proton beam that is striking a target may be exposed to a large flux of millicharged particles. Millicharged particles interact primarily through low momentum exchange producing electron recoil events near detector threshold. Recently, sub-MeV detection capabilities were demonstrated by the Fermilab ArgoNeuT detector, a small LAr detector which was exposed to the NuMI neutrino beam. Despite high background rates and its small size, we show that ArgoNeuT is capable of probing unexplored parameter space with its existing dataset. In particular, we show that the excellent spatial resolution in LAr detectors allows rejecting backgrounds by requiring two soft hits that are aligned with the upstream target. We further discuss the prospects of these types of searches in future larger LAr neutrino detectors such as the DUNE near detector.},

abstract = {Perhaps the deepest mystery of our accelerating universe in expansion is the existence of a tiny and rigid cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. Its size is many orders of magnitude below the expected one in the standard model of particle physics. This is a very welcome fact, namely if we care at all about our own existence and fate. However, we do not have a minimally satisfactory explanation for our good fortune and for the failing of the SM at that crucial point. To start with, an expanding universe is not expected to have a static vacuum energy density. We should rather observe a mildly dynamical behavior $\delta$$\Lambda$(t) {\textasciitilde} R {\textasciitilde} H2(t) with the expansion rate H. At the same time, it is natural to think that the huge value of the primeval vacuum energy (presumably connected to some GUT) was responsible for the initial inflationary phase. In the traditional inflaton models such phase is inserted by hand in the early epoch of the cosmic evolution, and it is assumed to match the standard $\Lambda$CDM regime during the radiation epoch. Here, instead, we consider a class of dynamical vacuum models which incorporate in a single vacuum structure $\Lambda$ ̄(H) the rapid stage of inflation, followed by the radiation and cold matter epochs, until achieving our dark energy universe. The early behavior of such {\textquotedblleft}running vacuum model{\textquotedblright} ($\Lambda$ ̄CDM) bares resemblance with Starobinsky{\textquoteright}s inflation in the early universe and is very close to the concordance model for the entire post-inflationary history. Most remarkably, the inflationary period in the $\Lambda$ ̄CDM terminates with {\textquotedblleft}graceful exit{\textquotedblright} and the large entropy problem can be solved. The model is compatible with the latest cosmological data on Hubble expansion and structure formation, and at the same time presents distinctive observational features that can be tested in the near future.},

abstract = {Search results are presented for physics beyond the standard model in final states with two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at {s} =  13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. The analysis uses the invariant mass of the lepton pair, searching for a kinematic edge or a resonant-like excess compatible with the Z boson mass. The search for a kinematic edge targets production of particles sensitive to the strong force, while the resonance search targets both strongly and electroweakly produced new physics. The observed yields are consistent with the expectations from the standard model, and the results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of supersymmetry. In a gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) model of gluino pair production with decay chains including Z bosons, gluino masses up to 1500-1770 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level depending on the lightest neutralino mass. In a model of electroweak chargino-neutralino production, chargino masses as high as 610 GeV are excluded when the lightest neutralino is massless. In GMSB models of electroweak neutralino-neutralino production, neutralino masses up to 500-650 GeV are excluded depending on the decay mode assumed. Finally, in a model with bottom squark pair production and decay chains resulting in a kinematic edge in the dilepton invariant mass distribution, bottom squark masses up to 980-1200 GeV are excluded depending on the mass of the next-to-lightest neutralino.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the geo--neutrino signal obtained from 1353 days of data with the Borexino detector at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. With a fiducial exposure of (3.69  0.16)  1031 proton  year after all selection cuts and background subtraction, we detected (14.3  4.4) geo-neutrino events assuming a fixed chondritic mass Th/U ratio of 3.9. This corresponds to a geo-neutrino signal Sgeo = (38.8  12.0) TNU with just a 6  10-6 probability for a null geo-neutrino measurement. With U and Th left as free parameters in the fit, the relative signals are STh = (10.6  12.7) TNU and SU = (26.5  19.5) TNU. Borexino data alone are compatible with a mantle geo--neutrino signal of (15.4  12.3) TNU, while a combined analysis with the KamLAND data allows to extract a mantle signal of (14.1  8.1) TNU. Our measurement of a reactor anti--neutrino signal Sreact = 84.5+19.3-18.9 TNU is in agreement with expectations in the presence of neutrino oscillations.},

The very large value of the neutral-current cross section due to coherence indicates a detector would be relatively light and suggests the possibility of a true "neutrino observatory." The recoil energy which must be detected is very small (10-${10}^{3}$ eV), however. We examine a realization in terms of the superconducting-grain idea, which appears, in principle, to be feasible through extension and extrapolation of currently known techniques. Such a detector could permit determination of the neutrino energy spectrum and should be insensitive to neutrino oscillations since it detects all neutrino types. Various applications and tests are discussed, including spallation sources, reactors, supernovas, and solar and terrestrial neutrinos. A preliminary estimate of the most difficult backgrounds is attempted.},

abstract = {A number of interventional procedures such as cardiac catheterization, angiography and the deployment of endovascular devices are routinely performed using x-ray fluoroscopy. To minimize the patient{\textquoteright}s exposure to ionizing radiation, each fluoroscopic image is acquired using a very low x-ray exposure ({\textasciitilde} 1 uR at the detector). At such an exposure, most semiconductor-based digital flat panel detectors (FPD) are not x-ray quantum noise limited (QNL) due to the presence of electronic noise which substantially degrades their imaging performance. The goal of this thesis was to investigate how a FPD based on amorphous selenium (a-Se) with internal avalanche multiplication gain could be used for QNL fluoroscopic imaging at the lowest clinical exposures while satisfying all of the requirements of a FPD for interventional radiology. 
 
 Towards this end, it was first determined whether a-Se can reliably provide avalanche multiplication gain in the solid-state. An experimental method was developed which enabled the application of sufficiently large electric field strengths across the a-Se. This method resulted in avalanche gains as high as 10000 at an applied field of 105 V/um using optical excitation. This was the first time such high avalanche gains have been reported in a solid-state detector based on an amorphous material. 
 
 Secondly, it was investigated how the solid-state a-Se avalanche detector could be used to image X-rays at diagnostic radiographic energies ({\textasciitilde} 75 kVp). A dual-layered direct-conversion FPD architecture was proposed. It consisted of an x-ray drift region and a charge avalanche multiplication region and was found to eliminate depth-dependent gain fluctuation noise. It was shown that electric field strength non-uniformities in the a-Se do not degrade the detective quantum efficiency (DQE). 
 
 Lastly, it was determined whether the solid-state a-Se avalanche detector satisfies all of the requirements of interventional radiology. Experimental results have shown that the total noise produced by the detector is negligible and that QNL operation at the lowest fluoroscopic exposures is indeed possible without any adverse effects occurring at much larger radiographic exposures. In conclusion, no fundamental obstacles were found preventing the use of avalanche a-Se in next-generation solid-state QNL FPDs for use in interventional radiology.},

Comparative studies with \ensuremath{\alpha} particles of 5.305 MeV found very little effect on the magnitude of the scintillation increase with orientation of the incident particle. The increase in scintillation was not associated with an observable decrease in charge collected and it may be due to a decrease of quenching in the track core of the incident particle.},

These electron-recoil limits significantly improve experimental constraints on dark matter particles with masses as low as 1 MeV/c2. We demonstrate a sensitivity to dark photons competitive with other leading approaches but using substantially less exposure (0.49 gram days). These results demonstrate the scientific potential of phonon-mediated semiconductor detectors that are sensitive to single electronic excitations.},

This improvement of two orders of magnitude in sensitivity over current limits is obtained by a significant increase of the $^{136}\mathrm{Xe}$ mass, the monolithic and homogeneous configuration of the active medium, and the multiparameter measurements of the interactions enabled by the time projection chamber. The detector concept and anticipated performance are presented based upon demonstrated realizable background rates.},

abstract = {The Borexino solar neutrino detector should begin operations in late 2006. This scintillation- based detector will observe low-energy neutrinos, in real time, down to about 250 keV. The experiment should further tighten constraints on the neutrino oscillation parameters, and confirm the Standard Solar Model of solar neutrino production. It may also observe geoneu- trinos; supernova neutrinos, should the timing of the experiment be fortunate; and perhaps other processes beyond the scope of the Standard Model of particle physics.
At the heart of Borexino lie 300 tons of organic scintillator fluid, contained by a spherical vessel composed of transparent nylon film. Roughly 300 tons of passive buffer fluid lie between this inner vessel and a second outer nylon vessel. Both vessels are located inside a steel sphere that also supports over 2000 inward-pointing photomultiplier tubes. The two most vital components of Borexino are these nylon vessels and the scintillator itself. Numerous measurements made at Princeton of the physical and radiochemical properties of the vessel film are reported in this thesis.
A 4-ton prototype of Borexino, the CTF, has been used to study scintillator radiopurity for over ten years. However, certain peculiarities of its design make determining the spatial positions of radioactive decays within the detector difficult. The development of a new position reconstruction code that takes these problems into account is reported herein.
Several studies of radiopurity in the latest version of CTF were made using this new code. These include a proposal for individually tagging decays of radon and four daughter iso- topes; an attempt to detect convection using the radon daughters; a hypothesis to explain peculiar behavior of the crucial isotope 210Po; and an analysis of 40K contamination in- side the detector based on models of the spatial distribution of external $\gamma$ rays, leading to a somewhat concerning result. A final distillation test of the scintillator will take place shortly, and will match as closely as possible the procedure used to purify scintillator for the full Borexino detector. Analyses run on CTF data collected after this test should prove vital in understanding the detector sensitivity of Borexino.},

The tumor uptake reached a peak by 30 min and remained relatively constant up to 60 min, with a very slow wash-out of F-18 activity from the tumor thereafter. Tumor-to-normal tissue and tumor-to-blood ratios ranged from 2.10-9.15 and 2.61-17.82, respectively, depending on the type of tumor. A scintiscan of a seminoma in a dog showed very high uptake in the viable part and lack of uptake in the necrotic mass. Toxicological studies in mice using 1000 times human tracer dose (HTD) per wk for 3 wk and in dogs using 50 times HTD per wk for 3 wk did not show any evidence of acute or chronic toxicity.},

abstract = {A newly introduced PET/CT scanner (Discovery Meaningful Insights{\textemdash}DMI, GE Healthcare) includes the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) with time-of-flight (TOF) technology first used in the GE SIGNA PET/MRI. In this study, we investigated the impact of various acquisition times on image quality using this SiPM-based PET/CT. We reviewed data from 58 participants with cancer who were scanned using the DMI PET/CT scanner. The administered dosages ranged 295.3{\textendash}429.9{\&}nbsp;MBq (mean {\textpm} SD 356.3 {\textpm} 37.4) and imaging started at 71{\textendash}142{\&}nbsp;min (mean {\textpm} SD 101.41 {\textpm} 17.52) after administration of the radiopharmaceutical. The patients{\textquoteright} BMI ranged 19.79{\textendash}46.16 (mean {\textpm} SD 26.55 {\textpm} 5.53). We retrospectively reconstructed the raw TOF data at 30, 60, 90, and 120{\&}nbsp;s/bed and at the standard image acquisition time per clinical protocol (180 or 210{\&}nbsp;s/bed depending on BMI). Each reconstruction was reviewed blindly by two nuclear medicine physicians and scored 1{\textendash}5 (1{\textemdash}poor, 5{\textemdash}excellent quality). The liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was used as a quantitative measure of image quality. The average scores {\textpm} SD of the readers were 2.61 {\textpm} 0.83, 3.70{\&}nbsp;{\textpm} 0.92, 4.36 {\textpm} 0.82, 4.82 {\textpm} 0.39, and 4.91 {\textpm} 0.91 for the 30, 60, 90, and 120{\&}nbsp;s/bed and at standard acquisition time, respectively. Inter-reader agreement on image quality assessment was good, with a weighted kappa of 0.80 (95% CI 0.72{\textendash}0.81). In the evaluation of the effects of time per bed acquisition on semi-quantitative measurements, we found that the only time point significantly different from the standard time were 30 and 60{\&}nbsp;s (both with P {\&}lt; 0.001). The effects of dose and BMI were not statistically significant (P = 0.195 and 0.098, respectively). There was a significant positive effect of time on SNR (P {\&}lt; 0.001), as well as a significant negative effect of weight (P {\&}lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that despite significant delays from injection to imaging (due to comparison with standard PET/CT) compared to standard clinical operations and even in a population with average BMI {\&}gt; 25, images can be acquired as fast as 90{\&}nbsp;s/bed using the SiPM PET/CT and still result in very good image quality (average score {\&}gt; 4).},

abstract = {WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat $\Lambda$-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters are h = 0.72 {\textpm} 0.05, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.024 {\textpm} 0.001, $\Omega$mh2 = 0.14 {\textpm} 0.02, $\tau$ = 0.166, ns = 0.99 {\textpm} 0.04, and $\sigma$8 = 0.9 {\textpm} 0.1. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Ly$\alpha$ forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Ly$\alpha$ forest data to find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h = 0.71, $\Omega$bh2 = 0.0224 {\textpm} 0.0009, $\Omega$mh2 = 0.135, $\tau$ = 0.17 {\textpm} 0.06, ns(0.05 Mpc-1) = 0.93 {\textpm} 0.03, and $\sigma$8 = 0.84 {\textpm} 0.04. WMAP's best determination of $\tau$ = 0.17 {\textpm} 0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7 {\textpm} 0.2 Gyr. With the Ly$\alpha$ forest data, the model favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Ly$\alpha$ forest.~~~~~By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the geometry of the universe, $\Omega$tot = 1.02 {\textpm} 0.02, and the equation of state of the dark energy, w < -0.78 (95% confidence limit assuming w $\ge$ -1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy density in stable neutrinos: $\Omega$$\nu$h2 < 0.0072 (95% confidence limit). For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.},

An analysis of ultrasound signals accompanying bubble nucleations confirms that alpha decays generate a significantly louder acoustic emission than single nuclear recoils, leading to an efficient background discrimination. Three dark matter candidate events were observed during an effective exposure of $28.1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{kg}\text{ }\mathrm{day}$, consistent with a neutron background. This observation provides strong direct detection constraints on weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-proton spin-dependent scattering for WIMP masses ${\&}gt;20\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$.},

abstract = {The AMoRE (Advanced Mo-based Rare process Experiment) project is a series of experiments that use advanced cryogenic techniques to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of . The work is being carried out by an international collaboration of researchers from eight countries. These searches involve high precision measurements of radiation-induced temperature changes and scintillation light produced in ultra-pure [100]-enriched and [48]-depleted calcium molybdate (48deplCa100MoO4) crystals that are located in a deep underground laboratory in Korea. The  nuclide was chosen for this  decay search because of its high Q-value and favorable nuclear matrix element. Tests have demonstrated that  crystals produce the brightest scintillation light among all of the molybdate crystals, both at room and at cryogenic temperatures. 48deplCa100MoO4 crystals are being operated at milli-Kelvin temperatures and read out via specially developed metallic-magnetic-calorimeter (MMC) temperature sensors that have excellent energy resolution and relatively fast response times. The excellent energy resolution provides good discrimination of signal from backgrounds, and the fast response time is important for minimizing the irreducible background caused by random coincidence of two-neutrino double-beta decay events of  nuclei. Comparisons of the scintillating-light and phonon yields and pulse shape discrimination of the phonon signals will be used to provide redundant rejection of alpha-ray-induced backgrounds. An effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity that reaches the expected range of the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, i.e., 20-50 meV, could be achieved with a 200{\textasciitilde}kg array of 48deplCa100MoO4 crystals operating for three years.},

abstract = {The low-noise operation of readout electronics in a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) is critical to properly extract the distribution of ionization charge deposited on the wire planes of the TPC, especially for the induction planes. This paper describes the characteristics and mitigation of the observed noise in the MicroBooNE detector. The MicroBooNE's single-phase LArTPC comprises two induction planes and one collection sense wire plane with a total of 8256 wires. Current induced on each TPC wire is amplified and shaped by custom low-power, low-noise ASICs immersed in the liquid argon. The digitization of the signal waveform occurs outside the cryostat. Using data from the first year of MicroBooNE operations, several excess noise sources in the TPC were identified and mitigated. The residual equivalent noise charge (ENC) after noise filtering varies with wire length and is found to be below 400 electrons for the longest wires (4.7 m). The response is consistent with the cold electronics design expectations and is found to be stable with time and uniform over the functioning channels. This noise level is significantly lower than previous experiments utilizing warm front-end electronics.},

Here we explore novel methods of detecting such radiation from astrophysical sources by means of matter-wave interferometers (MIGOs), using atomic beams emanating from supersonic atomic sources that are further cooled and collimated by means of optical molasses. While the sensitivities of such MIGOs compare favorably with LIGO and LISA, the sizes of MIGOs can be orders of magnitude smaller, and their bandwidths wider. Using a pedagogical approach, we place this problem into the broader context of problems at the intersection of quantum mechanics with general relativity.},

Detailed measurements of the photoconversion gain factor W {\textpm} and gain fluctuations $\sigma$ have been obtained to facilitate applications using a-Se and to provide a better understanding of the charge formation process. The measurements were made with an x-ray spectrometer constructed using a-Se as the x-ray absorber. Pulse height spectra of known monoenergetic x-ray sources were measured to determine the response of the a-Se. Both the gain and fluctuations calculated from the data were found to depend on the x-ray energy $\varepsilon$, and the applied field E, indicating the recombination of a larger amount of charge that was created initially.},

This method can be used to determine the mean residence time of groundwater in the range of 10^5 {\textendash} 10^6 a.  It requires a sample of 100 ml STP of Kr extracted from approximately two tons of water.  With modern atmospheric Kr samples, we demonstrate that the ratios measured by ATTA and LLC are directly proportional to each other within the measurement error of {\textpm}10%; we calibrate the 81Kr/Kr ratio of modern air measured using this method; and we show that the 81Kr/Kr ratios of samples extracted from air before and after the development of the nuclear industry are identical within the measurement error.},

abstract = {Solar neutrinos, since their first detection nearly forty years ago, have revealed valuable information regarding the source of energy production in the Sun, and have demonstrated that neutrino oscillations are well described by the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) oscillation parameters with matter interactions due to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect. 								 This thesis presents a precision measurement of the <super>7</super>Be solar neutrino interaction rate within Borexino, an underground liquid scintillator detector that is designed to measure solar neutrino interactions through neutrino-electron elastic scattering. The thesis includes a detailed description of the analysis techniques developed and used for this measurement as well as an evaluation of the relevant systematic uncertainties that affect the precision of the result. 								 The rate of neutrino-electron elastic scattering from 0.862 MeV <super>7</super>Be neutrinos is determined to be 45.4 +/- 1.6 (stat) +/- 1.5 (sys) counts/day/100 ton. Due to extensive detector calibrations and improved analysis methods, the systematic uncertainty in the interaction rate has been reduced by more than a factor of two from the previous evaluation. In the no-oscillation hypothesis, the interaction rate corresponds to a 0.862 MeV <super>7</super>Be electron neutrino flux of (2.75 +/- 0.13) x 10<super>9</super> cm<super>-2</super> sec<super>-1</super>. 								 Including the predicted neutrino flux from the Standard Solar Model yields an electron neutrino survival probability of Pee 0.51 +/- 0.07 and rules out the no-oscillation hypothesis at 5.1{\&}sigma. The LMA-MSW neutrino oscillation model predicts a transition in the solar Pee value between low ( < 1 MeV) and high (> 10 MeV) energies which has not yet been experimentally confirmed. This result, in conjunction with the Standard Solar Model, represents the most precise measurement of the electron neutrino survival probability for solar neutrinos at sub-MeV energies.},

abstract = {The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab reports results from an analysis of $\nu$e appearance data from 12.84  1020 protons on target in neutrino mode, an increase of approximately a factor of two over previously reported results. A $\nu$e charged-current quasi-elastic event excess of 381.2  85.2 events (4.5 $\sigma$) is observed in the energy range 200<E$\nu$QE<1250{\textasciitilde}MeV. Combining these data with the  $\nu$e appearance data from 11.27  1020 protons on target in antineutrino mode, a total $\nu$e plus  $\nu$e charged-current quasi-elastic event excess of 460.5  95.8 events (4.8 $\sigma$) is observed. If interpreted in a standard two-neutrino oscillation model, {$\nu$}$\mu$  {$\nu$}e, the best oscillation fit to the excess has a probability of 20.1% while the background-only fit has a $\chi$2-probability of 5  10-7 relative to the best fit. The MiniBooNE data are consistent in energy and magnitude with the excess of events reported by the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND), and the significance of the combined LSND and MiniBooNE excesses is 6.1 $\sigma$. All of the major backgrounds are constrained by in-situ event measurements, so non-oscillation explanations would need to invoke new anomalous background processes. Although the data are fit with a standard oscillation model, other models may provide better fits to the data.},

abstract = {As direct dark matter experiments continue to increase in size, they will become sensitive to neutrinos from astrophysical sources. For experiments that do not have directional sensitivity, coherent neutrino scattering from several sources represents an important background to understand, as it can almost perfectly mimic an authentic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) signal. Here we explore in detail the effect of neutrino backgrounds on the discovery potential of WIMPs over the entire mass range of 500 MeV to 10 TeV. We show that, given the theoretical and measured uncertainties on the neutrino backgrounds, direct detection experiments lose sensitivity to light ($\ensuremath{\sim}10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$) and heavy ($\ensuremath{\sim}100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$) WIMPs with a spin-independent cross section below ${10}^{\ensuremath{-}45}$ and ${\text{10}}^{\ensuremath{-}49}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$, respectively.},

A dangerous surface background is the $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ nuclear recoils produced by $^{210}\mathrm{Po}$ decays. In this paper, we report the first characterization of this background in liquid argon. The scintillation signal of low energy Pb recoils is measured to be highly quenched in argon, and we estimate that the 103 keV $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ recoil background will produce a signal equal to that of a $\ensuremath{\sim}5\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{keV}$ (30 keV) electron recoil ($^{40}\mathrm{Ar}$ recoil). In addition, we demonstrate that this dangerous $^{210}\mathrm{Po}$ surface background can be suppressed, using pulse shape discrimination methods, by a factor of $\ensuremath{\sim}100$ or higher, which can make argon dark matter detectors near background-free and enhance their potential for discovery of medium- and high-mass WIMPs. We also discuss the impact on other low background experiments.},

Data for the vapour pressure isotope effect in the ice range gave a good fit to the equation ln([graphic omitted])= 3.710/T+ 0.00132 (223 < T < 273), and those in the liquid range to ln ([graphic omitted])= 5.869/T{\textendash} 0.0108 (293 < T < 443).From the temperature dependence of the vapour pressure ratios the isotope effects on the heat of sublimation and evaporation were calculated. At the melting point $\Delta$($\Delta$Hsub)= 31 J mol{\textendash}1 while $\Delta$($\Delta$Hevap)= 77 J mol{\textendash}1 were found. The results are compared with earlier measurements and with data for the HOH/DOD system, where the isotope effect on the heat of fusion is much larger and of opposite sign.},

abstract = {Scientists have now accumulated overwhelming evidence indicating that over 80% of the mass of the universe is in the form of dark matter, neutral particles with ultra-weak couplings to ordinary matter. One compelling candidate is a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle or WIMP, with mass on the order of 100 GeV.The signal of a WIMP interaction in a detector is a low energy (typically below {\textasciitilde}100 keV) recoiling atomic nucleus. The expected rate is at most a few interactions per year per ton of target. The most critical issue for direct WIMP searches is reducing the background in the detector below this very low rate. Argon is a promising target because measurements of the scintillation pulse shape and the scintillation-to-ionization ratio allow the reduction of gamma-induced signals, the largest source of background, by a factor of 10<super>8</super> or better. One of the major drawbacks of argon is the presence of radioactive <super>39</super>Ar, which results in a decay rate of {\textasciitilde}1 Bq/kg in natural argon. Because <super>39</super>Ar is produced primarily in the upper atmosphere, the <super>39</super>Ar fraction can be reduced significantly by obtaining the argon from underground wells. Our collaboration, DarkSide, is developing a series of two-phase argon time projection chambers (TPCs) utilizing this depleted argon, along with passive shielding and active neutron and muon vetoes, for WIMP searches. I present results from a recent campaign of a 10 kg active mass prototype TPC that demonstrate the successful realization of many of the technical aspects necessary for a full-scale detector, in particular an electron-equivalent light yield of 4.5 photoelectrons per keV deposited, and a free electron lifetime in excess of 200 microseconds. Based on this successful prototype and Monte Carlo simulations, I then conclude that DarkSide-50, a 50 kg active mass TPC to be installed in LNGS, can likely acquire data background-free for three years, accumulating a fiducial exposure of {\textasciitilde}100 kg-years and reaching a sensitivity to the WIMP-nucleon cross section of {\textasciitilde}3{\&}times;10<super>45</super> cm<super>2</super>. I also present some details on the analysis of Borexino data that resulted in the first real-time, spectroscopic measurement of 7Be solar neutrino interactions.},

abstract = {The SuperCDMS experiment is designed to directly detect weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that may constitute the dark matter in our Galaxy. During its operation at the Soudan Underground Laboratory, germanium detectors were run in the CDMSlite mode to gather data sets with sensitivity specifically for WIMPs with masses ${\&}lt;10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$. In this mode, a higher detector-bias voltage is applied to amplify the phonon signals produced by drifting charges. This paper presents studies of the experimental noise and its effect on the achievable energy threshold, which is demonstrated to be as low as $56\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{eV}}_{\mathrm{ee}}$ (electron equivalent energy). The detector-biasing configuration is described in detail, with analysis corrections for voltage variations to the level of a few percent. Detailed studies of the electric-field geometry, and the resulting successful development of a fiducial parameter, eliminate poorly measured events, yielding an energy resolution ranging from $\ensuremath{\sim}9\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{eV}}_{\mathrm{ee}}$ at 0 keV to $101\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{eV}}_{\mathrm{ee}}$ at $\ensuremath{\sim}10\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{keV}}_{\mathrm{ee}}$. New results are derived for astrophysical uncertainties relevant to the WIMP-search limits, specifically examining how they are affected by variations in the most probable WIMP velocity and the Galactic escape velocity. These variations become more important for WIMP masses below $10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$. Finally, new limits on spin-dependent low-mass WIMP-nucleon interactions are derived, with new parameter space excluded for WIMP masses $\ensuremath{\lesssim}3\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$.},

Scintillation from the core can be quenched significantly by a biexcitonic mechanism. Some detailed calculations indicate that the electron-ion recombination may occur before exciton self-trapping. Fairly good agreement with experiment has been obtained with respect to the relative variation of the scintillation yield with LET using a diffusion-reaction model of free excitons with a specific reaction rate within acceptable limits. At the same LET different heavy-ion tracks can develop different quenching ratios depending on the density of deposited energy in the core.},

abstract = {The quenching factor for sodium recoils in a 2-inch Nal(Tl) scintillating crystal has been measured at room temperature. The crystal has been exposed to 2.45 MeV monoenergetic neutrons generated by a deuterium-deuterium fixed target accelerator in the energy range 10 to 100 keV nuclear recoil energy. A BC501A liquid scintillator detector has been used to tag neutrons that scatter off sodium nuclei in the crystal. Cuts on pulse shape discrimination in BC501A and neutron time of flight have been performed on pulses recorded by an Acqiris DC265 digitiser with a 2 ns sampling time. A quenching factor of 25.2 {\textpm} 6.4% has been determined for 10 keV sodium recoils. Measured quenching factors range from 19% to 26% in good agreement with other experiments. From pulse shape analysis, the mean time of pulses from electron and nuclear recoils have been compared down to 2 keV electron equivalent energy.},

abstract = {We have measured the electric field dependence of electron-ion recombination in liquid argon and xenon. The observed relationship is incompatible with Onsager's geminate theory [Phys. Rev. 54, 554 (1938)] of recombination so we have developed a new, single-parameter model to describe the data. The model is based on realistic assumptions about liquid argon and xenon and yields a simple, analytic result. This work is part of a program to build a high-resolution liquid-xenon detector.},

We show here that the successful detection of one or more PBHs by radio searches (with the Square Kilometer Array) and gravitational waves searches (with LIGO/Virgo and the upcoming Einstein Telescope) would set extraordinarily stringent constraints on virtually all weak-scale extensions of the Standard Model with stable relics, including those predicting a WIMP abundance much smaller than that of Dark Matter. Upcoming PBHs searches have in particular the potential to rule out almost the entire parameter space of popular theories such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model and scalar singlet Dark Matter.},

abstract = {The total neutron cross sections of the noble gases helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon have been measured for neutron energies from 120 kev to 6.2 Mev and from 12.1 Mev to 19.8 Mev by a transmission experiment. The neutrons were produced using the ${\mathrm{Li}}^{7}(p, n){\mathrm{Be}}^{7}$, the $\mathrm{T}(p, n){\mathrm{He}}^{3}$, the $\mathrm{D}(d, n){\mathrm{He}}^{3}$, and the $\mathrm{T}(d, n){\mathrm{He}}^{4}$ reactions in the appropriate energy intervals. A Van de Graaff accelerator was the source of the protons or deuterons. In general, the results obtained agree with previous work where such work exists. A previously unobserved $S$-wave scattering resonance was found in neon at about 500 kev, indicating the presence of an excited state in ${\mathrm{Ne}}^{21}$ with $J=\frac{1}{2}$ and even parity. The results for argon, krypton, and xenon exhibit general agreement with the cross sections of neighboring elements, as would be expected from the previously observed smooth variation of the $\ensuremath{\sigma}(A, E)$ surface.},

abstract = {While there is tremendous astrophysical and cosmological evidence for dark matter, its precise nature is one of the most significant open questions in modern physics. Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are a particularly compelling class of dark matter candidates with masses of the order 100 GeV and couplings to ordinary matter at the weak scale. Direct detection experiments are aiming to observe the low energy ({\&}lt;100 keV) scattering of dark matter off normal matter. With the liquid noble technology leading the way in WIMP sensitivity, no conclusive signals have been observed yet. The DarkSide experiment is looking for WIMP dark matter using a liquid argon target in a dual-phase time projection chamber located deep underground at Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. Currently filled with argon obtained from underground sources, which is greatly reduced in radioactive Ar-39, DarkSide-50 recently made the most sensitive measurement of the Ar-39 activity in underground argon and used it to set the strongest WIMP dark matter limit using liquid argon to date. This work describes the full chain of analysis used to produce the recent dark matter limit, from reconstruction of raw data to evaluation of the final exclusion curve. The DarkSide-50 apparatus is described in detail, followed by discussion of the low level reconstruction algorithms. The algorithms are then used to arrive at three broad analysis results: The electroluminescence signals in DarkSide-50 are used to perform a precision measurement of longitudinal electron diffusion in liquid argon. A search is performed on the underground argon data to identify the delayed coincidence signature of Kr-85 decays to the Rb-85m state, a crucial ingredient in the measurement of the Ar-39 activity in the underground argon. Finally, a full description of the WIMP search is given, including development of cuts, efficiencies, energy scale, and exclusion curve in the WIMP mass vs. spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section plane. This work was supervised by Hanguo Wang and was completed in collaboration with members of the DarkSide collaboration.},

abstract = {Recoil particles from the $^{210}\mathrm{Po}(\ensuremath{\alpha})^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ and $^{241}\mathrm{Am}(\ensuremath{\alpha})^{237}\mathrm{Np}$ disintegrations in surface deposits on platinum planchets have been studied experimentally using both a low-resolution magnetic spectrometer, employing an electron multiplier detector, and a hemispherical ionization chamber. The average energy of the $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ recoil ions emitted from thin deposits of $^{210}\mathrm{Po}$ showed an exponential degradation with time after preparation, starting with the nascent energy of 103 keV and decreasing to $\frac{2}{3}$ of this value in five days. Approximately 90% of the $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ recoil atoms are emitted singly ionized and 10% are doubly ionized. The $^{237}\mathrm{Np}$ recoils from thicker deposits of $^{241}\mathrm{Am}$ apparently were mostly neutral but a small number were emitted with six units of charge and with an average kinetic energy of only 65\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}15 keV compared with their nascent energy of 92.4 keV. Ejected recoils are accompanied by large numbers of secondary particles having energies less than 40 eV. With thin source deposits there are about five positively charged ions and three detected neutral secondary particles emitted per disintegration; but with thicker deposits these numbers rise to 15 positive ions and 10 neutrals, respectively. Negative ions may also be present but were excluded from observation by the experimental conditions. The average energy loss for the $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ recoil particle in passing through argon gas was determined to be 121\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}6 eV/ion-pair. The extrapolated range for a nascent energy $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ recoil particle in argon at STP is 78\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}2 \ensuremath{\mu}. This value agrees with the range reported by Jessi and Sadauskis and lies within 2% of the value calculated from an energy-loss theory originally developed by Bohr.},

A high-$Q$ cavity mode is used to ionize the gas periodically, a second high-$Q$ mode is used to determine the decay of electron density during the afterglow from the change of resonant frequency of the cavity, and a nonresonant waveguide mode is used to apply a constant microwave heating field to the electrons.

This result is reconciled with Fox and Hobson's ${T}^{\ensuremath{-}1.3}$ variation, obtained under conditions where ${T}_{e}={T}_{i}=T$, on the basis of their changing $\mathrm{Ar}_{2}^{}{}_{}{}^{+}$ vibrational-state populations with changing temperature. Finally, it is noted that our $T_{e}^{}{}_{}{}^{\ensuremath{-}0.67}$ variation may be evidence for appreciable electron capture via the indirect as well as the direct dissociative process.},

abstract = {In the last two decades the search for neutrinoless double beta decay has evolved into one of the highest priorities for understanding neutrinos and the origin of mass.  The main reason for this paradigm shift has been the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which clearly established the existence of massive neutrinos.  An additional motivation for conducting such searches comes from the existence of an unconfirmed, but not refuted, claim of evidence for neutrinoless double decay in 76Ge.  As a consequence, a new generation of experiments, employing different detection techniques and $\beta$$\beta$ isotopes, is being actively promoted by experimental groups across the world.  In addition, nuclear theorists are making remarkable progress in the calculation of the neutrinoless double beta decay nuclear matrix elements, thus eliminating a substantial part of the theoretical uncertainties affecting the particle physics interpretation of this process.  In this report, we review the main aspects of the double beta decay process and some of the most relevant experiments.  The picture that emerges is one where searching for neutrinoless double beta decay is recognized to have both far-reaching theoretical implications and promising prospects for experimental observation in the near future.},

abstract = {Motivated by the recent interest in light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\ensuremath{\sim}\mathcal{O}(10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2})$, an extension of the elastic, spin-independent, WIMP-nucleon cross-section limits resulting from the CRESST-II commissioning run (2007) are presented. Previously, these data were used to set cross-section limits from $1000\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ down to $\ensuremath{\sim}17\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$, using tungsten recoils, in 47.9 kg-days of exposure of calcium tungstate. Here, the overlap of the oxygen and calcium bands with the acceptance region of the commissioning run data set is reconstructed using previously published quenching factors. The resulting elastic WIMP cross-section limits, accounting for the additional exposure of oxygen and calcium, are presented down to $5\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$.},

abstract = {In the published cosmogenic background study for a ton-sized DarkSide dark matter search, only prompt neutron backgrounds coincident with cosmogenic muons or muon induced showers were considered, although observation of the initiating particle(s) was not required. The present paper now reports an initial investigation of the magnitude of cosmogenic background from $\beta$-delayed neutron emission produced by cosmogenic activity in DarkSide. The study finds a background rate for $\beta$-delayed neutrons in the fiducial volume of the detector on the order of < 0.1 event/year. However, detailed studies are required to obtain more precise estimates. The result should be compared to a radiogenic background event rate from the PMTs inside the DarkSide liquid scintillator veto of 0.2 events/year.},

It has been possible to separate the elastic scattering from the inelastic in all cases and to resolve the inelastic groups from specific nuclear levels for at least one level in all cases. A simple Born-approximation analysis of the elastic data yields values of the effective radii and surface thicknesses of the nuclear charge densities which (if suitably corrected for failure of the Born approximation) are in substantial agreement with the results of Hahn, Ravenhall, and Hofstadter; i.e., a radius parameter of $c\ensuremath{\cong}1.08 {A}^{\frac{1}{3}}\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}13}$ cm (radius to half-maximum of the charge distribution) and a surface thickness of $t\ensuremath{\cong}2.5\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}13}$ cm (thickness from 10% to 90% of the maximum of the charge distribution). Phenomenological analysis of the inelastic scattering along the lines laid down by Schiff yields some tentative multipolarity assignments, and application of some results of Ravenhall yields estimates of (radiative) partial level widths; for the $E2$ transitions these correspond to lifetimes of \ensuremath{\sim}19\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}${10}^{\ensuremath{-}13}$ sec (Mg 1.37 Mev) to \ensuremath{\sim}1.4\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}${10}^{\ensuremath{-}13}$ sec (Sr 1.85 Mev). The observed strengths of the transitions are compared to those predicted by Weisskopf theory.},

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemica...},

abstract = {Astrophysical observations indicate that dark matter constitutes most of the mass in our universe, but its nature remains unknown. Over the past decade, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS II) experiment has provided world-leading sensitivity for the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter. The final exposure of our low-temperature germanium particle detectors at the Soudan Underground Laboratory yielded two candidate events, with an expected background of 0.9 +/- 0.2 events. This is not statistically significant evidence for a WIMP signal. The combined CDMS II data place the strongest constraints on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent scattering cross section for a wide range of WIMP masses and exclude new parameter space in inelastic dark matter models.},

We found that a CdTe sensor layer with 3?mm thickness and 165?{\textmu}m pixel pitch is optimal with respect to the effective Majorana neutrino mass () sensitivity. In simulations, we were able to demonstrate a possible reduction of the background level caused by single electrons by approximately 75% at a specific background rate of 10-3 counts/() at a detection efficiency reduction of about 23% with track analysis employing random decision forests. Exploitation of the imaging properties with track analysis leads to an improvement in sensitivity to by about 22%. After 5 years of measuring time, the sensitivity to of a 420?kg CdTe experiment (90% enrichment) would be 59?meV on a 90% confidence level for a specific single-electron background rate of 10-3 counts/(). The a-particle background can be suppressed by at least about six orders of magnitude. The benefit of the hybrid pixel detector technology might be increased significantly if drift-time difference measurements would allow reconstruction of tracks in three dimensions.},

Heavy isotopes such as deuterium{\textendash}a type of hydrogen containing a neutron{\textendash}exist in small quantities in natural environments, but their effects on living organisms are unclear. Michael Snyder and Xiyan Li at Stanford University showed for the first time that amino acids in yeast cells tend to contain lower levels of heavy isotopes as the cells age. They then incubated yeast cells with increased doses of {\textquoteleft}heavy water{\textquoteright} (which contains deuterium instead of hydrogen) and found that, remarkably, the yeast{\textquoteright}s lifespan was extended by up to 85%. The researchers suggest that heavy isotopes affect biochemical reactions by strengthening molecular bonds, and suppress reactive oxygen species, thereby slowing the metabolism and prolonging life.},

abstract = {We present new constraints on sub-GeV dark-matter particles scattering off electrons based on 6780.0 kg d of data collected with the DarkSide-50 dual-phase argon time projection chamber. This analysis uses electroluminescence signals due to ionized electrons extracted from the liquid argon target. The detector has a very high trigger probability for these signals, allowing for an analysis threshold of three extracted electrons, or approximately 0.05 keVee. We calculate the expected recoil spectra for dark matter-electron scattering in argon and, under the assumption of momentum-independent scattering, improve upon existing limits from XENON10 for dark-matter particles with masses between 30 and $100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{MeV}/{c}^{2}$.},

abstract = {We report a measurement of the ionization efficiency of silicon nuclei recoiling with sub-keV kinetic energy in the bulk silicon of a charge-coupled device (CCD). Nuclear recoils are produced by low-energy neutrons (${\&}lt;24\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{keV}$) from a $^{124}\mathrm{Sb}\text{\ensuremath{-}}^{9}\mathrm{Be}$ photoneutron source, and their ionization signal is measured down to 60 eV electron equivalent. This energy range, previously unexplored, is relevant for the detection of low-mass dark matter particles. The measured efficiency is found to deviate from the extrapolation to low energies of the Lindhard model. This measurement also demonstrates the sensitivity to nuclear recoils of CCDs employed by DAMIC, a dark matter direct detection experiment located in the SNOLAB underground laboratory.},

abstract = {We give a classical confidence belt construction which unifies the treatment of upper confidence limits for null results and two-sided confidence intervals for non-null results. The unified treatment solves a problem (apparently not previously recognized) that the choice of upper limit or two-sided intervals leads to intervals which are not confidence intervals if the choice is based on the data. We apply the construction to two related problems which have recently been a battleground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Poisson processes with background and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our construction avoids unphysical confidence intervals. In contrast with some popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.},

A first principle based model, which takes into account both spatial and temporal gradients for the main culture variables, is presented. A previous model has been refined and extended in order to represent the main distributed phenomena, incorporating the dynamic effects related to culture temperature. Thereby, calibration and validation tests have been performed in an outdoor industrial tubular photobioreactor, showing successful results. The developed model considers both fluid dynamics and biological phenomena. This work summarizes the required steps to obtain a biological model from knowledge acquired in previous works. Finally, in view of the obtained results, conclusions about the limitations of the developed model are drawn, as well as its main uses and applications, describing a simulation example which proves how a simple control of culture conditions, such as temperature and pH, allows...},

abstract = {New data are reported from the operation of the PICO-60 dark matter detector, a bubble chamber filled with 36.8 kg of ${\mathrm{CF}}_{3}\mathrm{I}$ and located in the SNOLAB underground laboratory. PICO-60 is the largest bubble chamber to search for dark matter to date. With an analyzed exposure of 92.8 livedays, PICO-60 exhibits the same excellent background rejection observed in smaller bubble chambers. Alpha decays in PICO-60 exhibit frequency-dependent acoustic calorimetry, similar but not identical to that reported recently in a ${\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{F}}_{8}$ bubble chamber. PICO-60 also observes a large population of unknown background events, exhibiting acoustic, spatial, and timing behaviors inconsistent with those expected from a dark matter signal. These behaviors allow for analysis cuts to remove all background events while retaining 48.2% of the exposure. Stringent limits on weakly interacting massive particles interacting via spin-dependent proton and spin-independent processes are set, and most interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal as dark matter interacting with iodine nuclei are ruled out.},

abstract = {The ratio of the diffusion coefficient $D$ to the mobility $\ensuremath{\mu}$ for electrons has been measured in liquid argon by using a modified Townsend apparatus. The measured ratio $\frac{\mathrm{eD}}{\ensuremath{\mu}}$ monotonically increases from \ensuremath{\sim}0.1 to \ensuremath{\sim}0.4 eV with an increase in the electric field from \ensuremath{\sim}2 to \ensuremath{\sim}10 kV/cm. The ratio $\frac{\mathrm{eD}}{\ensuremath{\mu}}$ is smaller than that in gaseous argon at the same value of $\frac{E}{N}$, where $N$ is the atomic density. The mean momentum-transfer cross section $〈\ensuremath{\sigma}〉$ is estimated as a function of $〈\ensuremath{\epsilon}〉$ on the assumption $〈\ensuremath{\epsilon}〉=\frac{3eD}{2\ensuremath{\mu}}$, where $〈\ensuremath{\epsilon}〉$ is the mean electron agitation energy. Thus the $〈\ensuremath{\sigma}〉$ obtained is nearly constant (3\ensuremath{\sim}4\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}${10}^{\ensuremath{-}17}$ ${\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$) for $〈\ensuremath{\epsilon}〉$ from 0.15 to 0.6 eV. This value of $〈\ensuremath{\sigma}〉$ is almost the same as that estimated from the low-field mobility of electrons in liquid argon. This result is consistent with both Derenzo's experiment and Lekner's theory. It is concluded that there is no Ramsauer minimum at about 0.4 eV of $〈\ensuremath{\epsilon}〉$, where the minimum exists in gaseous argon.},

abstract = {Dark sectors, consisting of new, light, weakly-coupled particles that do not interact with the known strong, weak, or electromagnetic forces, are a particularly compelling possibility for new physics. Nature may contain numerous dark sectors, each with their own beautiful structure, distinct particles, and forces. This review summarizes the physics motivation for dark sectors and the exciting opportunities for experimental exploration. It is the summary of the Intensity Frontier subgroup "New, Light, Weakly-coupled Particles" of the Community Summer Study 2013 (Snowmass). We discuss axions, which solve the strong CP problem and are an excellent dark matter candidate, and their generalization to axion-like particles. We also review dark photons and other dark-sector particles, including sub-GeV dark matter, which are theoretically natural, provide for dark matter candidates or new dark matter interactions, and could resolve outstanding puzzles in particle and astro-particle physics. In many cases, the exploration of dark sectors can proceed with existing facilities and comparatively modest experiments. A rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program has been identified that has the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. These physics opportunities should be vigorously pursued in the US and elsewhere.},

abstract = {The properties of a Higgs boson candidate are measured in the $H\ensuremath{\rightarrow}ZZ\ensuremath{\rightarrow}4\ensuremath{\ell}$ decay channel, with $\ensuremath{\ell}=e$, $\ensuremath{\mu}$, using data from $pp$ collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $5.1\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{fb}}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ at the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{TeV}$ and $19.7\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{fb}}^{\ensuremath{-}\text{1}}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{TeV}$, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. The new boson is observed as a narrow resonance with a local significance of 6.8 standard deviations, a measured mass of $125.6\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.4(\text{stat})\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.2(\text{syst})\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$, and a total width $\ensuremath{\le}3.4\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$ at the 95% confidence level. The production cross section of the new boson times its branching fraction to four leptons is measured to be ${0.93}_{\ensuremath{-}0.23}^{+0.26}{(\text{stat})}_{\ensuremath{-}0.09}^{+0.13}(\text{syst})$ times that predicted by the standard model. Its spin-parity properties are found to be consistent with the expectations for the standard-model Higgs boson. The hypotheses of a pseudoscalar and all tested spin-1 boson hypotheses are excluded at the 99% confidence level or higher. All tested spin-2 boson hypotheses are excluded at the 95% confidence level or higher.},

In the present work Borexino data are used to set a bound on the existence of such decays.

abstract = {In this work, we propose a new theoretical approach to modeling the electron{\textminus}ion recombination processes in ionization tracks in liquid argon at 87 K. We developed a computer simulation method using realistic models of charge transport and electron{\textminus}ion reactions. By introducing the concept of one-dimensional periodicity in the track, we are able to model very large cylindrical structures of charged particles. We apply our simulation method to calculate the electron escape probability as a function of the initial ionization density in the track. The results are in quantitative agreement with experiment for radiation tracks of relatively high ionization density. At low ionization densities, the simulation results slightly overestimate the experimental data. We discuss possible reasons for this disagreement and conclude that it can be explained by the role of $\delta$ tracks (short tracks of secondary electrons) in electron{\textminus}ion recombination processes. We introduce an approximate model that takes into account the p...},

abstract = {A neutral atomic beam has been used to measure the total ionization cross section for argon atoms incident on low-density argon gas. The beam was produced by symmetric charge transfer of argon ions produced in an electron-impact ion source with 20-eV electrons. Beam energies varied from 30 eV (just below threshold for electron production in ground-state atom collisions) to 2900 eV laboratory energy. As in earlier work, the neutral beam intensity was determined by measurements of slow and scattered ion currents in the charge-transfer process. The intensities were checked by measurements of secondary electron emission from a gold target. Comparison of these measurements with those made at higher energies by other investigators suggests additional broad structure, with possibly a minimum near 8 keV.},

To a good approximation, this reevaluation applies to all reactor neutrino experiments. The synthesis of published experiments at reactor-detector distances ${\&}lt;100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{m}$ leads to a ratio of observed event rate to predicted rate of $0.976\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.024$. With our new flux evaluation, this ratio shifts to $0.943\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.023$, leading to a deviation from unity at 98.6% C.L. which we call the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The compatibility of our results with the existence of a fourth nonstandard neutrino state driving neutrino oscillations at short distances is discussed. The combined analysis of reactor data, gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments, and MiniBooNE-$\ensuremath{\nu}$ data disfavors the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8% C.L. The oscillation parameters are such that $|\ensuremath{\Delta}{m}_{\mathrm{new}}^{2}|{\&}gt;1.5\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{eV}}^{2}$ (95%) and ${sin﻿}^{2}(2{\ensuremath{\theta}}_{\mathrm{new}})=0.14\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.08$ (95%).

abstract = {In addition to a smooth component of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter in galaxies, there may be streams of material; the effects of WIMP streams on direct detection experiments is examined in this paper. The contribution to the count rate due to the stream cuts off at some characteristic energy. Near this cutoff energy, the stream contribution to the annual modulation of recoils in the detector is comparable to that of the thermalized halo, even if the stream represents only a small portion ($\ensuremath{\sim}5%$ or less) of the local halo density. Consequently the total modulation may be quite different than would be expected for the standard halo model alone: it may not be cosinelike and can peak at a different date than expected. The effects of speed, direction, density, and velocity dispersion of a stream on the modulation are examined. We describe how the observation of a modulation can be used to determine these stream parameters. Alternatively, the presence of a dropoff in the recoil spectrum can be used to determine the WIMP mass if the stream speed is known. The annual modulation of the cutoff energy together with the annual modulation of the overall signal provide a ``smoking gun'' for WIMP detection.},

abstract = {We determine constraints on sterile neutrino warm dark matter through direct detection experiments, taking XENON100, XENON1T, and DARWIN as examples. If keV-scale sterile neutrinos scatter inelastically with bound electrons of the target material, an electron recoil signal is generated. This can be used to set limits on the sterile neutrino mass and its mixing with the active sector. While not competitive with astrophysical constraints from x-ray data, the constraints are the first direct laboratory bounds on sterile neutrino warm dark matter and will be in some parts of parameter space the strongest limits on keV-scale neutrinos.},

abstract = {Current observations from astrophysics indicate the presence of dark matter, an invisible form of matter that makes up a large part of the mass of the universe. One of the leading theories for dark matter is that it is made up of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). One of the ways we try to discover WIMPs is by directly detecting their interaction with regular matter. This can be done using a scintillator such as liquid argon, which gives off light when a particle interacts with it. Liquid argon (LAr) is a favorable means of detecting WIMPs because it has an inherent property that enables a technique called pulse-shape discrimination (PSD). PSD can distinguish a WIMP signal from the constant background of electromagnetic signals from other sources, like gamma rays. However, there are other background signals that PSD is not as capable of rejecting, such as those caused by alpha decays on the interior surfaces of the detector. Radioactive elements that undergo alpha decay are introduced to detector surfaces during construction by radon gas that is naturally present in the air, as well as other means. When these surface isotopes undergo alpha decay, they can produce WIMP-like signals in the detector. We present here two LAr experiments. The first (RaDOSE) discovered a property of an organic compound that led to a technique for rejecting surface alpha decays in LAr detectors with high efficiency. The second (DarkSide-50) is a dark matter experiment operated at LNGS in Italy and is the work of an international collaboration. A detailed look is given into alpha decays and surface backgrounds present in the detector, and projections are made of alpha-related backgrounds for 500 live days of data. The technique developed with RaDOSE is applied to DarkSide-50 to determine its effectiveness in practice. It is projected to suppress the surface background in DarkSide-50 by more than a factor of 1000.},

abstract = {In the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI), oscillation data are affected by a degeneracy which allows the solar mixing angle to be in the second octant (aka the dark side) and implies a sign flip of the atmospheric mass-squared difference. This leads to an ambiguity in the determination of the ordering of neutrino masses, one of the main goals of the current and future experimental neutrino program. We show that the recent observation of coherent neutrino--nucleus scattering by the COHERENT experiment, in combination with global oscillation data, excludes the NSI degeneracy at the 3.1$\sigma$ (3.6$\sigma$) CL for NSI with up (down) quarks.},

Our measurement of signal responses to nuclear recoils agrees with predictions from the NEST model. However, our measured ionization (scintillation) yields for electronic recoils are consistently higher (lower) than those from the NEST model by about $5{\mathrm{e}}^{\ensuremath{-}}/{\mathrm{keV}}_{ee}$ ($\mathrm{ph}/{\mathrm{keV}}_{ee}$) at all scanned drift fields. New recombination parameters based on the Thomas-Imel box model are derived from our data. Given the lack of precise measurement of scintillation and ionization yields for low energy electronic recoils in liquid xenon previously, our new measurement provides so far the best available data covering low energy regions at different drift fields for liquid xenon detectors relevant to dark matter searches.},

abstract = {Liquid argon-based scintillation detectors are important for dark matter searches and neutrino detection. Argon scintillation light is in the vacuum ultraviolet region, making it hard to be detected by conventional means. Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), an optically transparent thermoplastic polyester commercially available as large area sheets or rolls, is proposed as an alternative wavelength shifter to the commonly-used tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). By combining the existing literature data and spectrometer measurements relative to TPB, we conclude that the fluorescence yield and timing of both materials are very close. This suggests that PEN is a suitable replacement for TPB. Advantages of PEN are discussed in the context of scaling-up existing technologies to the next generation of very large ktonne-scale detectors. Its simplicity has a potential to facilitate such scale-ups, revolutionizing the field.},

abstract = {Various indices that characterize the statistical fluctuations in the ionization yield for electron incidence are discussed. The indices include the variance, the moments, the central moments, and the cumulants, all defined in terms of the probability $P({T}_{0},j)$ that an electron of kinetic energy ${T}_{0}$ causes, upon complete slowing down, exactly $j$ ion pairs. Like the mean ionization yield, each of the indices is expressible as an integral over the current energy $T$ of electrons. The integrand is a product of the Spencer-Fano degradation spectrum $y({T}_{0},T)$ for source energy ${T}_{0}$ with another factor, and displays contributions from different values of $T$ to the quantity of interest. It has been shown for the first time that the cumulant of any order (including the variance as a special case) receives contributions from different $T$ nearly the same way as the mean ionization yield. Therefore, ${T}_{0}$ greatly exceeding the first ionization threshold, every cumulant is roughly proportional to ${T}_{0}$, just as the mean yield is. This leads to a generalization of the Fano factor. Thus the present findings reinforce the importance of the cumulant notion in statistical physics in general. Numerical work on molecular hydrogen as an example substantiates the general conclusion and predicts the value 0.30 for the Fano factor for an electron of initial energy 10 keV.},

Application of an external electric field of about 3 kV/cm leads to an initial enhancement of the scintillation by 17% in the neat liquid and as much as 22% in allene solutions. Scintillation and ionization yields generally are strongly dependent on field strength, they are similar for both ions, and they are usually very different from that found with \ensuremath{\alpha} particles. Ionization yields are found to increase by more than an order of magnitude with the addition of 10 ppm allene. This increase occurs mainly because of the photoionization of allene by the liquid-argon scintillation. A considerable amount of quenching is observed in these systems and even with the huge increase in ionization allene is not very efficient in converting scintillation to ionic pairs. The potential energy resolution of allene-doped liquid-argon detectors is discussed. \textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {A theoretical discussion is given of the range of heavy ions with moderat e velocity.  The treatment is based on the theory of quasi-elastic collisions given elsewhere.  The region where electronic and nuclear stopping compete is of particular interest.  Use is made of a simple velocity proportional Thomas-Fermi type formula for electronic stopping, and a universal approximate differential cross section for scattering.  Simplified models of nuclear scattering assuming power law scattering are also included.  They turn out to be useful for exploratory computations of various range quantities.
The straightforward theory of ranges is studied in {\textsection}2.  Range curves are
computed for any atomic numbers of particle Z1, and substance Z2.  It is found that when nuclear stopping is dominating, a $\rho$ - $\varepsilon$ plot gives a universal range energy description.
Probability distribution in total range and various averages are studied
({\textsection}3), in order to assess corrections to measurements when necessary.  Similarly, corrections to measurements of projected ranges are obtained ({\textsection}4).  The range correction due to nuclear stopping is obtained for ions of high initial energy.
In {\textsection}5 a survey is given of numerous recent measurements of range.  They are found to be in fair accord with theoretical results, for energies between 100 MeV (fission fragments) and {\textasciitilde}1 keV.},

abstract = {Dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the observable Universe. Yet the physical nature of these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein suggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses, which drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting structures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the reasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By reconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests that both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The model is a modified $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that continuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and can flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic universe with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing compatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological measurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative mass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms haloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are not cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the observed distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles. The model makes several testable predictions and seems to have the potential to be consistent with observational evidence from distant supernovae, the cosmic microwave background, and galaxy clusters. These findings may imply that negative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or alternatively may imply the existence of a superseding theory that in some limit can be modelled by effective negative masses. Both cases lead to the surprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the dark Universe may have been due to a simple sign error.},

The analysis is based on four months of data taken with the far Double Chooz reactor anti-neutrino detector.  Using only rate information yields a best fit value of sin2(2theta 13) equal to 0.0934+/-0.0785 (1 sigma).  Incorporating information on the shape of the signal energy spectrum in the analysis results in a best fit value of 0.0849+/-0.0509 (1 sigma).  Based on frequentist studies, sin2(2theta13)=0 is excluded at the 92.6% confidence level.  The frequentist construction using DeltaChi2 as an ordering rule gives [0.0098, 0.1825] interval for sin2(2theta 13) at 90% C.L.},

abstract = {Results are presented from the first underground data run of ZEPLIN-II, a 31 kg two-phase xenon detector developed to observe nuclear recoils from hypothetical weakly interacting massive dark matter particles. Discrimination between nuclear recoils and background electron recoils is afforded by recording both the scintillation and ionisation signals generated within the liquid xenon, with the ratio of these signals being different for the two classes of event. This ratio is calibrated for different incident species using an AmBe neutron source and 60Co $\gamma$-ray sources. From our first 31 live days of running ZEPLIN-II, the total exposure following the application of fiducial and stability cuts was 225 kg {\texttimes} days. A background population of radon progeny events was observed in this run, arising from radon emission in the gas purification getters, due to radon daughter ion decays on the surfaces of the walls of the chamber. An acceptance window, defined by the neutron calibration data, of 50% nuclear recoil acceptance between 5 keVee and 20 keVee, had an observed count of 29 events, with a summed expectation of 28.6 {\textpm} 4.3 $\gamma$-ray and radon progeny induced background events. These figures provide a 90% c.l. upper limit to the number of nuclear recoils of 10.4 events in this acceptance window, which converts to a WIMP{\textendash}nucleon spin-independent cross-section with a minimum of 6.6 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}7 pb following the inclusion of an energy-dependent, calibrated, efficiency. A second run is currently underway in which the radon progeny will be eliminated, thereby removing the background population, with a projected sensitivity of 2 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}7 pb for similar exposures as the first run.},

abstract = {About 99 per cent of solar energy is produced through sequences of nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium, starting from the fusion of two protons (the pp chain). The neutrinos emitted by five of these reactions represent a unique probe of the Sun{\textquoteright}s internal working and, at the same time, offer an intense natural neutrino beam for fundamental physics. Here we report a complete study of the pp chain. We measure the neutrino{\textendash}electron elastic-scattering~rates for neutrinos produced by four reactions of the chain: the initial proton{\textendash}proton~fusion, the electron-capture decay of beryllium-7, the three-body proton{\textendash}electron{\textendash}proton (pep) fusion,~here measured with the highest precision so far achieved, and the boron-8 beta decay, measured with the lowest energy~threshold. We also set a limit on the neutrino flux produced by the 3He{\textendash}proton fusion (hep). These measurements provide a direct determination of the relative intensity of the two primary terminations of the pp chain (pp-I and pp-II) and an indication that the temperature profile in the Sun is more compatible with solar models that assume high surface metallicity. We also determine the survival probability of solar electron neutrinos at different energies, thus probing simultaneously and with high precision the neutrino~flavour-conversion paradigm, both in vacuum and in matter-dominated regimes.},

abstract = {Organometallic chemistry has recently gained a lot of attention in the domain of plastic scintillators. Homogenously dispersed metal complexes in a polymer matrix can afford plastic scintillators with unseen abilities. Heavy atom loading is very attractive as it gives access to plastics with increased sensitivity towards elusive radiations such as gamma and neutron. But this comes with a drawback, as heavy atoms tend to quench fluorescence, hence decreasing the scintillation yield. We present here a comprehensive study of this phenomenon with bismuth and gadolinium complexes. We investigate the influence of the ligand nature by varying organometallic and fluorophore concentration to probe their interaction. We also propose an explanation of the difference in behavior between these two metals. These results were applied to the fabrication of large volume loaded plastic scintillators (>100 cm3). Bismuth loaded scintillators displayed characteristics equivalent to lead loaded commercial materials, and gadolinium samples proved to be able to capture thermal neutrons and release gamma rays.},

abstract = {Recently, we proposed paleo-detectors as a method for the direct detection of Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter. In paleo-detectors, one would search for the persistent traces left by dark matter-nucleon interactions in ancient minerals. Thanks to the large integration time of paleo-detectors, relatively small target masses suffice to obtain exposures, i.e. the product of integration time and target mass, much larger than what is feasible in the conventional direct detection approach. Here, we discuss the paleo-detector proposal in detail, in particular, a range of background sources. For low-mass WIMPs with masses m$\chi$10\,GeV, the largest contribution to the background budget comes from nuclear recoils induced by coherent scattering of solar neutrinos. For heavier WIMPs, the largest background source is nuclear recoils induced by fast neutrons created by heavy radioactive contaminants, particularly 238U; neutrons can arise in spontaneous fission or from $\alpha$-particles created in 238U decays. We also discuss the challenges of mineral optimization, specifically the determination of readily available minerals from rocks in deep boreholes which are able to record persistent damage from nuclear recoils. In order to suppress backgrounds induced by radioactive contaminants, we propose to use minerals found in marine evaporites or in ultra-basic rocks. We estimate the sensitivity of paleo-detectors to spin-independent and spin-dependent WIMP-nucleus interactions. In all interaction cases considered here, the sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs with masses m$\chi$10\,GeV extends to WIMP-nucleon cross sections many orders of magnitude smaller than current upper limits. For heavier WIMPs with masses m$\chi$30\,GeV cross sections a factor of a few to 100 smaller than current upper limits can be probed by paleo-detectors. [Abridged]},

abstract = {Spirulina platensis (SP) is a filamentous cyanobacterium microalgae with potent dietary phyto-antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous properties. The present study aimed to investigate the chemopreventive effect of SP against rat liver toxicity and carcinogenesis induced by dibutyl nitrosamine (DBN) precursors, and further characterized its underlying mechanisms of action in HepG2 cell line. Investigation by light and electron microscopy showed that DBN treatment induced severe liver injury and histopathological abnormalities, which were prevented by SP supplementation. The incidence of liver tumors was significantly reduced from 80 to 20% by SP. Immunohistochemical results indicated that both PCNA and p53 were highly expressed in the liver of DBN-treated rats, but were significantly reduced by SP supplementation. Molecular analysis indicated that SP treatment inhibited cell proliferation, which was accompanied by increased p21 and decreased Rb expression levels at 48hrs post-treatment. In addition, SP increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression, indicating induction of apoptosis by 48hrs. This is the first report of the in vivo chemopreventive effect of SP against DBN-induced rat liver cytotoxicity and carcinogenesis, suggesting its potential use in chemoprevention of cancer.},

abstract = {The (x, y) position reconstruction method used in the analysis of the complete exposure of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is presented. The algorithm is based on a statistical test that makes use of an iterative method to recover the photomultiplier tube (PMT) light response directly from the calibration data. The light response functions make use of a two dimensional functional form to account for the photons reflected on the inner walls of the detector. To increase the resolution for small pulses, a photon counting technique was employed to describe the response of the PMTs. The reconstruction was assessed with calibration data including {}83mKr (releasing a total energy of 41.5 keV) and {}3H ($\beta$^- with Q = 18.6 keV) decays, and a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) neutron beam (2.45 MeV). In the horizontal plane, the reconstruction has achieved an (x, y) position uncertainty of $\sigma$= 0.82 cm for events of only 200 electroluminescence photons and $\sigma$ = 0.17 cm for 4,000 electroluminescence photons. Such signals are associated with electron recoils of energies 0.25 keV and 10 keV, respectively. The reconstructed position of the smallest events with a single electron emitted from the liquid surface has a horizontal (x, y) uncertainty of 2.13 cm.},

abstract = {An abundance of astrophysical and cosmological evidence indicates the existence of a non-luminous, non-baryonic form of matter, called dark matter, that is approximately a quarter of all energy in the universe. One promising candidate for dark matter is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) which interacts with baryonic matter at most on the scale of the weak force. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment aims to detect the nuclear recoils induced by the elastic scattering of WIMPs off of germanium nuclei. This is a rare signal and difficult to detect, especially the low-energy recoils that are produced by low-mass dark matter. The CDMS project operated at the Soudan Underground Laboratory from 2003--2015, with an upgrade to the SuperCDMS experiment in 2012. The germanium detectors were operated at 50{\textasciitilde}mK and able to measure both the ionization and athermal phonons produced in a particle interaction. Measuring two signals enables discrimination between electron recoil and nuclear recoil events. An alternative operating mode for the detectors is called the CDMS low ionization threshold experiment (CDMSlite), where a higher bias was applied to the detectors and only the phonon signal analyzed. This method increased sensitivity to low-mass dark matter interactions, but sacrificed discrimination capability. The CDMSlite spectrum had a large contribution from electron recoil background events. From the information gained during the first two CDMSlite Runs, a background model was developed for the third and final CDMSlite Run. Analytical descriptions were identified for those backgrounds that were theoretically known, e.g. tritium $\beta$-spectrum, and Geant simulations were used to understand and predict the low-energy spectra from other sources, e.g. Compton scattering. Multiple new models were developed for detectors operated in CDMSlite at Soudan. These include the analytical formula for Compton scattering, and empirical models for surface backgrounds from $^{210}$Pb contamination of the germanium crystals and detector housing. In order to accurately describe the surface events, a new detector response function was developed that included information about the electric field and energy resolution of the detector. These models were essential to the implementation of a profile likelihood analysis of the CDMSlite Run 3 data, which improved on the sensitivity to dark matter over the Run 2 optimum interval analysis for WIMP masses above 2.5{\textasciitilde}GeV/$c^2$. This demonstrated a successful application of a likelihood analysis to the high-voltage operating mode, and the potential for these analyses in the future SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment. For the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment, the change in background rates from radiogenic neutrons was considered as additional towers of detectors were added, and the feasibility of an active neutron veto as a potential upgrade for large payloads was studied. This veto could be constructed of plastic scintillator with layers of gadolinium resin, and would aid in reducing the nuclear recoil single scatter background that is indistinguishable from the WIMP signal.},

A profile likelihood ratio analysis allows 90% CL upper limits to be set on the WIMP-neutron (WIMP-proton) cross section of $\sigma$n = 1.6 10-41 cm2 ($\sigma$p = 5 10-40 cm2) at 35 GeVc-2, almost a sixfold improvement over the previous LUX spin-dependent results. The spin-dependent WIMP-neutron limit is the most sensitive constraint to date.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To determine the relation between exposure to glycaemia over time and the risk of macrovascular or microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.

DESIGN:Prospective observational study.

SETTING:23 hospital based clinics in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

PARTICIPANTS:4585 white, Asian Indian, and Afro-Caribbean UKPDS patients, whether randomised or not to treatment, were included in analyses of incidence; of these, 3642 were included in analyses of relative risk.

OUTCOME MEASURES:Primary predefined aggregate clinical outcomes: any end point or deaths related to diabetes and all cause mortality. Secondary aggregate outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation (including death from peripheral vascular disease), and microvascular disease (predominantly retinal photo-coagulation). Single end points: non-fatal heart failure and cataract extraction. Risk reduction associated with a 1% reduction in updated mean HbA(1c) adjusted for possible confounders at diagnosis of diabetes.

RESULTS:The incidence of clinical complications was significantly associated with glycaemia. Each 1% reduction in updated mean HbA(1c) was associated with reductions in risk of 21% for any end point related to diabetes (95% confidence interval 17% to 24%, P<0.0001), 21% for deaths related to diabetes (15% to 27%, P<0.0001), 14% for myocardial infarction (8% to 21%, P<0.0001), and 37% for microvascular complications (33% to 41%, P<0.0001). No threshold of risk was observed for any end point.

CONCLUSIONS:In patients with type 2 diabetes the risk of diabetic complications was strongly associated with previous hyperglycaemia. Any reduction in HbA(1c) is likely to reduce the risk of complications, with the lowest risk being in those with HbA(1c) values in the normal range (<6.0%).},

Such a success was only possible by a strict quality control program during the construction phase of the experiment. In this paper, we describe how construction materials and auxiliary systems of the BOREXINO detector were screened for their residual radioactivity with unprecedented high sensitivity. The highly sensitive assay techniques developed for this purpose were also used to validate the purity of water and nitrogen used in the experiment. Moreover, we report on the production of 222Rn-free nitrogen and synthetic air with very low 222Rn concentration as well as on the successful search for commercial nitrogen with a particularly low concentration of argon and krypton.},

Extensive vibrational excitation of CF4 was observed with electrons of very low incident energies. There was some evidence of multiple vibrational excitation in SiH4 also but the results for this molecule were not totally unambiguous. Nearthreshold vibrational excitation of SiF4 was masked by effects attributed to a large cross-section for elastic scattering. Some optically forbidden electronic states have been located and assignments suggested. Short-lived negative-ion states (resonances) affect electronic excitation of the lowest excited Rydberg state in SiH4, CF4 and SiF4 as well as negative-ion production.},

abstract = {Oxalate toxicity is mediated through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a process that is partly dependent on mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we investigated whether C-phycocyanin (CP) could protect against oxidative stress-mediated intracellular damage triggered by oxalate in MDCK cells. DCFDA, a fluorescence-based probe and hexanoyl-lysine adduct (HEL), an oxidative stress marker were used to investigate the effect of CP on oxalate-induced ROS production and membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO). The role of CP against oxalate-induced oxidative stress was studied by the evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential by JC1 fluorescein staining, quantification of ATP synthesis and stress-induced MAP kinases (JNK/SAPK and ERK1/2). Our results revealed that oxalate-induced cells show markedly increased ROS levels and HEL protein expression that were significantly decreased following pre-treatment with CP. Further, JC1 staining showed that CP pre-treatment conferred significant protection from mitochondrial membrane permeability and increased ATP production in CP-treated cells than oxalate-alone-treated cells. In addition, CP treated cells significantly decreased the expression of phosphorylated JNK/SAPK and ERK1/2 as compared to oxalate-alone-treated cells. We concluded that CP could be used as a potential free radical-scavenging therapeutic strategy against oxidative stress-associated diseases including urolithiasis.},

abstract = {The Borexino detector measures solar neutrino fluxes via neutrino-electron elastic scattering. Observed spectra are determined by the solar-$\nu$e survival probability Pee(E), and the chiral couplings of the neutrino and electron. Some theories of physics beyond the Standard Model postulate the existence of Non-Standard Interactions (NSI's) which modify the chiral couplings and Pee(E). In this paper, we search for such NSI's, in particularly neutral-current-like interactions that modify the $\nu$e - e and $\nu$$\tau$ - e couplings, using Borexino Phase II data. Standard Solar Model predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes for both high- and low-metallicity assumptions are considered. No indication of new physics is found at the level of sensitivity of the detector and constraints on the parameters of the NSI's are placed. In addition, with the same dataset the value of 2$\theta$W is obtained with a precision comparable to that achieved in reactor antineutrino experiments.},

These discoveries were remarkable not only because they were unexpected--they were discoveries in the purest sense--but that they were made initially by experiments whose primary goals were aimed at other physics. Future solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments will also be sensitive to a broad range of physics and thus to new and unexpected phenomena. We discuss here the physics which can be done by new solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments and what we believe to be the highest priorities for the next generation of detectors.},

abstract = {Purpose: The authors describe a detailed Monte Carlo(MC) method for the coupled transport of ionizing particles and charge carriers in amorphous selenium (a-Se) semiconductor x-ray detectors, and model the effect of statistical variations on the detected signal. Methods: A detailed transport code was developed for modeling the signal formation process in semiconductor x-ray detectors. The charge transport routines include three-dimensional spatial and temporal models of electron-hole pair transport taking into account recombination and trapping. Many electron-hole pairs are created simultaneously in bursts from energy deposition events. Carrier transport processes include drift due to external field and Coulombic interactions, and diffusion due to Brownian motion. Results: Pulse-height spectra (PHS) have been simulated with different transport conditions for a range of monoenergetic incident x-ray energies and mammography radiation beam qualities. Two methods for calculating Swank factors from simulated PHS are shown, one using the entire PHS distribution, and the other using the photopeak. The latter ignores contributions from Compton scattering and K-fluorescence. Comparisons differ by approximately 2% between experimental measurements and simulations. Conclusions: The a-Se x-ray detector PHS responses simulated in this work include three-dimensional spatial and temporal transport of electron-hole pairs. These PHS were used to calculate the Swank factor and compare it with experimental measurements. The Swank factor was shown to be a function of x-ray energy and applied electric field. Trapping and recombination models are all shown to affect the Swank factor.},

The angular distributions of the lepton pairs in this channel are sensitive to the spin-parity of the boson.

abstract = {For on-site inspections (OSI) under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) measurement of the noble gas 37Ar is considered an important technique. 37Ar is produced underground by neutron activation of Calcium by the reaction 40Ca(n,$\alpha$)37Ar. The naturally occurring equilibrium 37Ar concentration balance in soil air is a function of an exponentially decreasing production rate from cosmic ray neutrons with increasing soil depth, diffusive transport in the soil air, and radioactive decay (T1/2: 35 days). In this paper for the first time, measurements of natural 37Ar activities in soil air are presented. The highest activities of ∼100 mBq m{\textendash}3 air are 2 orders of magnitude larger than in the atmosphere and are found in 1.5{\textendash}2.5 m depth. At depths >8 m 37Ar activities are <20 mBq m{\textendash}3 air. After identifying the main 37Ar production and gas transport factors the expected global activity range distribution of 37Ar in shallow subsoil (0.7 m below the surface) was estimated.

abstract = {Borexino has been running since May 2007 at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy with the primary goal of detecting solar neutrinos. The detector, a large, unsegmented liquid scintillator calorimeter characterized by unprecedented low levels of intrinsic radioactivity, is optimized for the study of the lower energy part of the spectrum. During Phase-I (2007\char21{}2010), Borexino first detected and then precisely measured the flux of the $^{7}\mathrm{Be}$ solar neutrinos, ruled out any significant day-night asymmetry of their interaction rate, made the first direct observation of the pep neutrinos, and set the tightest upper limit on the flux of solar neutrinos produced in the CNO cycle (carbon, nitrogen, oxigen) where carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen serve as catalysts in the fusion process. In this paper we discuss the signal signature and provide a comprehensive description of the backgrounds, quantify their event rates, describe the methods for their identification, selection, or subtraction, and describe data analysis. Key features are an extensive in situ calibration program using radioactive sources, the detailed modeling of the detector response, the ability to define an innermost fiducial volume with extremely low background via software cuts, and the excellent pulse-shape discrimination capability of the scintillator that allows particle identification. We report a measurement of the annual modulation of the $^{7}\mathrm{Be}$ neutrino interaction rate. The period, the amplitude, and the phase of the observed modulation are consistent with the solar origin of these events, and the absence of their annual modulation is rejected with higher than 99% C.L. The physics implications of Phase-I results in the context of the neutrino oscillation physics and solar models are presented.},

Previous work has argued that the DAMA annual modulation signal might be explained in such a scenario. Detailed predictions are difficult due to the inherent complexities involved in modelling the halo plasma interactions with Earth-bound dark matter. Here, we consider a simple phenomenological model for the dark matter velocity function relevant for direct detection experiments, and confront the resulting electron scattering rate with the new DAMA/LIBRA phase 2 data. We also consider the constraints from other experiments, including XENON100 and DarkSide-50.},

abstract = {A dedicated test of the effects of Nitrogen contamination in liquid Argon has been performed at the INFN-Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS, Italy) within the WArP R{\&}D program. A detector has been designed and assembled for this specific task and connected to a system for the injection of controlled amounts of gaseous Nitrogen into the liquid Argon. The purpose of the test is to detect the reduction of the Ar scintillation light emission as a function of the amount of the Nitrogen contaminant injected in the Argon volume. A wide concentration range, spanning from {\textasciitilde} 10{\textminus}1 ppm up to {\textasciitilde} 103 ppm, has been explored. Measurements have been done with electrons in the energy range of minimum ionizing particles ($\gamma$-conversion from radioactive sources). Source spectra at different Nitrogen contaminations are analyzed, showing sensitive reduction of the scintillation yield at increasing concentrations. Direct PMT signal acquisition exploiting high time resolution by fast waveform recording allowed high precision extraction of the main characteristics of the scintillation light emission in contaminated LAr. In particular, the decreasing behavior in lifetime and relative amplitude of the slow component is found to be appreciable starting from (1 ppm) of Nitrogen concentrations. The rate constant of the quenching process induced by Nitrogen in liquid Ar has been found to be kQ(N2) = 0.11 {\textpm} 0.01 $\mu$s{\textminus}1ppm{\textminus}1, consistent with a previous measurement of this quantity but with significant improvement in precision. On the other hand, no evidence for absorption by N2 impurities has been found up to the higher concentrations here explored.},

abstract = {The direction dependence of the event rate in WIMP direct detection experiments provides a powerful tool for distinguishing WIMP events from potential backgrounds. We use a variety of (nonparametric) statistical tests to examine the number of events required to distinguish a WIMP signal from an isotropic background when the uncertainty in the reconstruction of the nuclear recoil direction is included in the calculation of the expected signal. We consider a range of models for the Milky Way halo, and also study rotational symmetry tests aimed at detecting nonsphericity/isotropy of the Milky Way halo. Finally we examine ways of detecting tidal streams of WIMPs. We find that if the senses of the recoils are known then of order ten events will be sufficient to distinguish a WIMP signal from an isotropic background for all of the halo models considered, with the uncertainties in reconstructing the recoil direction only mildly increasing the required number of events. If the senses of the recoils are not known the number of events required is an order of magnitude larger, with a large variation between halo models, and the recoil resolution is now an important factor. The rotational symmetry tests require of order a thousand events to distinguish between spherical and significantly triaxial halos, however a deviation of the peak recoil direction from the direction of the solar motion due to a tidal stream could be detected with of order a hundred events, regardless of whether the sense of the recoils is known.},

abstract = {We investigate a concept for making a large area, flat-panel detector for digital radiology. It employs an x-ray sensitive photoconductor to convert incident x-radiation to a charge image which is then electronically read out with a large area integrated circuit. The large area integrated circuit, also called an active matrix, consists of a two-dimensional array of thin film transistors(TFTs). The potential advantages of the flat-panel detector for digital radiography include: instantaneous digital radiographs without operator intervention; compact size approaching that of a screen-film cassette and thus compatibility with existing x-ray equipment; high quantum efficiency combined with high resolution. Its potential advantages over the x-ray image intensifier (XRII)/video systems for fluoroscopy include: compactness; geometric accuracy; high resolution, and absence of veiling glare. The feasibility of the detector for digital radiology was investigated using the properties of a particular photoconductor (amorphous selenium) and active matrix array (with cadmium selenide TFTs). The results showed that it can potentially satisfy the detector design requirements for radiography (e.g., chest radiography and mammography). For fluoroscopy, the images can be obtained in real-time but the detector is not quantum noise limited below the mean exposure rate typically used in fluoroscopy. Possible improvements in x-ray sensitivity and noise performance for the application in fluoroscopy are discussed.},

abstract = {While there is tremendous astrophysical and cosmological evidence for dark matter, its precise nature is one of the most significant open questions in modern physics. Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are a particularly compelling class of dark matter candidates with masses of the order 100 GeV and couplings to ordinary matter at the weak scale. Direct detection experiments are aiming to observe the low energy ({\&}lt;100 keV) scattering of dark matter off normal matter. With the liquid noble technology leading the way in WIMP sensitivity, no conclusive signals have been observed yet. The DarkSide experiment is looking for WIMP dark matter using a liquid argon target in a dual-phase time projection chamber located deep underground at Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. Currently filled with argon obtained from underground sources, which is greatly reduced in radioactive Ar-39, DarkSide-50 recently made the most sensitive measurement of the Ar-39 activity in underground argon and used it to set the strongest WIMP dark matter limit using liquid argon to date. This work describes the full chain of analysis used to produce the recent dark matter limit, from reconstruction of raw data to evaluation of the final exclusion curve. The DarkSide-50 apparatus is described in detail, followed by discussion of the low level reconstruction algorithms. The algorithms are then used to arrive at three broad analysis results: The electroluminescence signals in DarkSide-50 are used to perform a precision measurement of longitudinal electron diffusion in liquid argon. A search is performed on the underground argon data to identify the delayed coincidence signature of Kr-85 decays to the Rb-85m state, a crucial ingredient in the measurement of the Ar-39 activity in the underground argon. Finally, a full description of the WIMP search is given, including development of cuts, efficiencies, energy scale, and exclusion curve in the WIMP mass vs. spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section plane. This work was supervised by Hanguo Wang and was completed in collaboration with members of the DarkSide collaboration.},

Data were taken at 30\ifmmode^\circ\else\textdegree\fi{} intervals between 0\ifmmode^\circ\else\textdegree\fi{} and 150\ifmmode^\circ\else\textdegree\fi{} for proton energies high enough to produce ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) neutrons above the detection threshold (300 kev). Since the yield of the ($p, n$) reaction is more highly peaked in the forward direction than that of the ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) reaction, the ratio of the ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) to ($p, n$) intensities grows with increasing angle, severely limiting the usefulness of the ($p, n$) reaction as a neutron source above the ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) threshold at back angles. Absolute differential and total cross sections for both groups have been calculated from the data. A comparison with theory for total cross sections and angular distributions suggests the existence of three previously unidentified levels in ${\mathrm{Be}}^{8}$. One level, with ${J}^{\ensuremath{\pi}}={1}^{\ensuremath{-}}$, near the threshold for the ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) reaction, is responsible for the fast rise in the ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) total cross section near threshold. A second level, corresponding to an incident proton energy of about 3.0 Mev, does not contribute significantly to the yield of the ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) reaction; the data are consistent with an assignment of ${J}^{\ensuremath{\pi}}={1}^{+}$ and a total width of 1 Mev. The bulk of the total cross-section curve for the ($p, {n}^{\ensuremath{'}}$) reaction has been fitted by assuming a ${1}^{+}$ level corresponding to an incident proton energy of 3.5 Mev, with ${{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{n}}^{2}\ensuremath{\simeq}{{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{p}}^{2}$, ${{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{{n}^{\ensuremath{'}}}}^{2}\ensuremath{\simeq}5{{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{p}}^{2}$, and ${{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{{p}^{\ensuremath{'}}}}^{2}\ensuremath{\ll}{{\ensuremath{\gamma}}_{p}}^{2}$.},

Phantom experiments were performed using 18F-solution and an IEC body phantom of the type described in the NEMA NU-2 2012 standard. The minimum scanning time required for the detection of a 10-mm hot sphere with a 4:1 target-to-background ratio, the phantom noise equivalent count (NECphantom), % background variability (N 10mm), % contrast (Q H,10mm), and recovery coefficient (RC) were calculated according to the Japanese guideline. The measured spatial resolution ranged from 4.5- to 5-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). The sensitivity and scatter fraction were 3.8{\&}nbsp;cps/kBq and 37.3%, respectively. The peak noise-equivalent count rate was 70{\&}nbsp;kcps in the presence of 29.6{\&}nbsp;kBq{\&}nbsp;mL{\textminus}1 in the phantom. The system energy resolution was 12.4% and the TOF timing resolution was 411{\&}nbsp;ps at FWHM. Minimum scanning times of 2, 7, 6, and 2{\&}nbsp;min per bed position, respectively, are recommended for visual score, noise-equivalent count (NEC)phantom, N 10mm, and the Q H,10mm to N 10mm ratio (QNR) by the Japanese guideline. The RC of a 10-mm-diameter sphere was 0.49, which exceeded the minimum recommended value. The Celesteion large-bore PET/CT system had low sensitivity and NEC, but good spatial and time resolution when compared to other PET/CT scanners. The QNR met the recommended values of the Japanese guideline even at 2{\&}nbsp;min. The Celesteion is therefore thought to provide acceptable image quality with 2{\&}nbsp;min/bed position acquisition, which is the most common scan protocol in Japan.},

Using this source, a $\ensuremath{\lesssim}10%$ quenching factor is measured for sodium recoils below $24\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{keV}}_{\mathrm{nr}}$ in NaI[Tl]. This is considerably smaller than the 30% typically adopted in the interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter experiment, resulting in a marked increase of its tension with other searches, under the standard set of phenomenological assumptions. The method is illustrated for other target materials (superheated and noble liquids).},

abstract = {It is generally acknowledged that calibration of the imaging system (be it a SPECT or a PET scanner) is one of the critical components associated with in vivo activity quantification in nuclear medicine. The system calibration is generally performed through the acquisition of a source with a known amount of radioactivity. The decay-corrected calibration factor is the {\&}{\#}x201c;output{\&}{\#}x201d; quantity in a measurement model for the process. This quantity is a function of a number of {\&}{\#}x201c;input{\&}{\#}x201d; variables, including total counts in the volume of interest (VOI), radionuclide activity concentration, source volume, acquisition duration, radionuclide half-life, and calibration time of the radionuclide. Uncertainties in the input variables propagate through the calculation to the {\&}{\#}x201c;combined{\&}{\#}x201d; uncertainty in the output quantity. In the present study, using the general formula given in the GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) for aggregating uncertainty components, we derive a practical relation to assess the combined standard uncertainty for the calibration factor of an emission tomography system. At a time of increasing need for accuracy in quantification studies, the proposed approach has the potential to be easily implemented in clinical practice.},

abstract = {New data are reported from the operation of a 2 liter ${\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{F}}_{8}$ bubble chamber in the SNOLAB underground laboratory, with a total exposure of 211.5 kg days at four different energy thresholds below 10 keV. These data show that ${\mathrm{C}}_{3}{\mathrm{F}}_{8}$ provides excellent electron-recoil and alpha rejection capabilities at very low thresholds. The chamber exhibits an electron-recoil sensitivity of ${\&}lt;3.5\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}1{0}^{\ensuremath{-}10}$ and an alpha rejection factor of ${\&}gt;98.2%$. These data also include the first observation of a dependence of acoustic signal on alpha energy. Twelve single nuclear recoil event candidates were observed during the run. The candidate events exhibit timing characteristics that are not consistent with the hypothesis of a uniform time distribution, and no evidence for a dark matter signal is claimed. These data provide the most sensitive direct detection constraints on WIMP-proton spin-dependent scattering to date, with significant sensitivity at low WIMP masses for spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering.},

abstract = {A wide range of observational evidence suggests that the matter content of the Universe is dominated by a non-baryonic and non-luminous component: dark matter. One of the most favoured candidate for dark matter is a big-bang relic population of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The DarkSide program aims to the direct detection of WIMPs with a dual-phase liquid argon TPC and a background free exposure. The first phase of the experiment, DarkSide-50, is running since Oct 2013 and has (46 {\textpm} 0.7) kg active mass. A first run, with an atmospheric argon fill (AAr), provided the most sensitive limit ever obtained by an argon-based experiment. The current run, with an underground argon fill (UAr, depleted in 39Ar), represents a milestone towards the construction of DarkSide-20k, a low-background dual-phase TPC with a fiducial mass of 20 t. This work is been mainly devoted to the description of G4DS, the DarkSide Monte Carlo simulation, and to its applications. G4DS is a GEANT4-based simulation, it provides the geometry description of each detector of the DarkSide program, it is tuned to reproduce the DarkSide-50 response at the percent level and incorporates a custom model for ionisation and scintillation mechanisms in liquid argon, tuned on real data. The principal applications of the simulation include the estimate of the neutron and gamma backgrounds for DarkSide-50, the measurement of the 39Ar depletion factor in UAr with respect to AAr and the design studies for DarkSide-20k.},

abstract = {The JUNO liquid scintillator-based experiment, construction of which is on-going in Jiangmen (China), will start operations in 2020 and will detect anti-neutrinos from nearby reactors; but also solar neutrinos via elastic scattering on electrons. Its physics goals are broad; its primary aim to measure the neutrino mass ordering demands to collect large statistics, which requires JUNO's 20 kt sensitive mass, and achieve an unprecedented energy resolution (3%/{E}). Thanks to these characteristics, JUNO is in a very good position to contribute to the solar neutrino studies in the line of previous experiments of similar technology. It will collect a large sample of neutrinos from 7Be and 8B. In particular, for 7Be the target energy resolution will provide a powerful tool to isolate the electron energy end point from backgrounds like 210Bi and 85Kr. At the same time, challenges will have to be faced mainly related to the reduction and estimation of the backgrounds. While a thorough LS purification campaign is being planned, the desired level of purification is less aggressive than e.g. in Borexino. Also, cosmogenic backgrounds such as cosmic ray muons traversing the relatively thin layer of ground above JUNO (700 m) and crossing the detector will need to be vetoed with dedicated techniques for the extraction of 8B. In my talk I reviewed JUNO's preliminary analysis strategy and challenges in the solar neutrino sector; and provided the current estimates of its solar neutrino and background yields, with related energy spectra, assuming two benchmark scenarios of scintillator radio-purity.},

We determined the rate of $pep$ solar neutrino interactions in Borexino to be $3.1\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}{0.6}_{\mathrm{stat}}\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}{0.3}_{\mathrm{syst}}\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{counts}/(\mathrm{day}\ifmmode\cdot\else\textperiodcentered\fi{}100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{ton})$. Assuming the $pep$ neutrino flux predicted by the standard solar model, we obtained a constraint on the CNO solar neutrino interaction rate of ${\&}lt;7.9\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{counts}/(\mathrm{day}\ifmmode\cdot\else\textperiodcentered\fi{}100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{ton})$ ($95%$ C.L.). The absence of the solar neutrino signal is disfavored at $99.97%$ C.L., while the absence of the $pep$ signal is disfavored at $98%$ C.L. The necessary sensitivity was achieved by adopting data analysis techniques for the rejection of cosmogenic $^{11}\mathrm{C}$, the dominant background in the 1\char21{}2 MeV region. Assuming the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein large mixing angle solution to solar neutrino oscillations, these values correspond to solar neutrino fluxes of $(1.6\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.3)\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{8}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{\ensuremath{-}2}\text{ }{\mathrm{s}}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ and ${\&}lt;7.7\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{8}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{\ensuremath{-}2}\text{ }{\mathrm{s}}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ ($95%$ C.L.), respectively, in agreement with both the high and low metallicity standard solar models. These results represent the first direct evidence of the $pep$ neutrino signal and the strongest constraint of the CNO solar neutrino flux to date.},

Several experiments have claimed to rule out DAMA/LIBRA, but the comparisons are made based on dark matter halo and dark matter-interaction models that are currently unknown. Therefore, an unambiguous test of DAMA/LIBRA is best made using NaI(Tl) crystals with lower residual background than that of DAMA/LIBRA, and the SABRE experiment is designed to achieve this goal. In this paper we will discuss the development of high-purity SABRE NaI(Tl) crystals and detectors, and progress of the SABRE experiment toward testing DAMA/LIBRA.},

We discuss what we think are the most important perspectives on the plausible and natural scenarios for neutrinos and attempt to throw light onto the flavor problem of quarks and leptons. This review focuses on the see-saw mechanism, which fits into a big picture of particle physics such as supersymmetry and grand unification, providing a unified approach to the flavor problem of quarks and leptons. We argue that, in combination with family symmetries, this may be at the heart of a unified understanding of the flavor puzzle. We also discuss other new physics ideas, such as neutrinos in models with extra dimensions, and possible theoretical implications of sterile neutrinos. We outline some tests for the various schemes.},

abstract = {The Daya Bay experiment has observed correlations between reactor core fuel evolution and changes in the reactor antineutrino flux and energy spectrum. Four antineutrino detectors in two experimental halls were used to identify 2.2 million inverse beta decays (IBDs) over 1230 days spanning multiple fuel cycles for each of six 2.9 GWth reactor cores at the Daya Bay and Ling Ao nuclear power plants. Using detector data spanning effective 239Pu fission fractions, F239, from 0.25 to 0.35, Daya Bay measures an average IBD yield, {$\sigma$}f, of (5.90  0.13)  10-43 cm2/fission and a fuel-dependent variation in the IBD yield, d$\sigma$f/dF239, of (-1.86  0.18)  10-43 cm2/fission. This observation rejects the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino flux as a function of the 239Pu fission fraction at 10 standard deviations. The variation in IBD yield was found to be energy-dependent, rejecting the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino energy spectrum at 5.1 standard deviations. While measurements of the evolution in the IBD spectrum show general agreement with predictions from recent reactor models, the measured evolution in total IBD yield disagrees with recent predictions at 3.1$\sigma$. This discrepancy indicates that an overall deficit in measured flux with respect to predictions does not result from equal fractional deficits from the primary fission isotopes 235U, 239Pu, 238U, and 241Pu. Based on measured IBD yield variations, yields of (6.17  0.17) and (4.27  0.26)  10-43 cm2/fission have been determined for the two dominant fission parent isotopes 235U and 239Pu. A 7.8% discrepancy between the observed and predicted 235U yield suggests that this isotope may be the primary contributor to the reactor antineutrino anomaly.},

abstract = {No matter where you are on the learning curve, this one-stop sourcebook delivers the kind of previously hard-to-find practical information you'll appreciate - and the wide range of application circuit alternatives you need - to optimize the noise, offset, bandwidth, and stability performance of photodiode amplifiers. Featuring the insights and accumulated knowledge that could only come from the world's number one authority on the subject, this is no scholarly tome but a hands-on reference - one that provides you with generalized circuit solutions that quickly adapt to specific design and application requirements. Inside, you'll find clear, complete, and largely stand-alone discussions of such topics as how the op amp current-to-voltage converter serves as the basic photodiode amplifier; the role of photodiode capacitance in an amplifier's AC response, along with design equations for optimum phase compensation; noise analysis, identification, and reduction; and wideband, high-gain, and position-sensing photodiode amplifiers. In all, this information-packed guide is without question the photodiode "bible" for anyone dealing with electronic design issues.},

abstract = {CoGeNT has taken data for over 3 years, with 1136 live days of data accumulated as of April 23, 2013. We report on the results of a maximum likelihood analysis to extract any possible dark matter signal present in the collected data. The maximum likelihood signal extraction uses 2-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) to characterize the anticipated variations in dark matter interaction rates for given observable nuclear recoil energies during differing periods of the Earth's annual orbit around the Sun. Cosmogenic and primordial radioactivity backgrounds are characterized by their energy signatures and in some cases decay half-lives. A third parameterizing variable -- pulse rise-time -- is added to the likelihood analysis to characterize slow rising pulses described in prior analyses. The contribution to each event category is analyzed for various dark matter signal hypotheses including a dark matter standard halo model and a case with free oscillation parameters (i.e., amplitude, period, and phase). The best-fit dark matter signal is in close proximity to previously reported results. We find that the significance of the extracted dark matter signal remains well below evidentiary at 1.7 $\sigma$.},

The maximum pulse sizes, ${P}_{M}$, for $\ensuremath{\alpha}$-particles depend only on the field strength, $E$, and not on the electrode spacing, proving that the pulse limiting effect is columnar recombination and not electron trapping by impurities. The maximum pulse sizes obey the equation $(\frac{{P}_{M}}{{P}_{0}})=1\ensuremath{-}\mathrm{exp}(\ensuremath{-}A{E}^{\frac{1}{2}})$, where ${P}_{0}$ is the $\ensuremath{\alpha}$-pulse size in an argon gas counter. The counting efficiency for $\ensuremath{\alpha}$-particles is close to 100 percent, but there is some variation in pulse size due to variation of columnar recombination with angle of emission. No $\ensuremath{\alpha}$- or $\ensuremath{\gamma}$-pulses were observed in liquid nitrogen or heptane, but weak $\ensuremath{\alpha}$-induced pulses were observed in liquid methane.},

abstract = {The isotope (13C) has a widespread application in many fields such as chemistry, physics, medicine, etc. To obtain a high concentration in isotope of interest, in our case (13C), it is used the method of cryogenic distillation of carbon monoxide (CO) which is based on the difference between the vapor pressure of (12C16O) and (13C16O) at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Isotopic separation plant, used to obtain the isotope (13C), is a complex installation, with many inputs and outputs, rather difficult to control. Due to this reason, from the point of view of automation, it is needed a simplified mathematical model. This model can be determined only with some presumption and simplification assumptions. Using the physical laws, the hydrodynamic part of the process and the mass balance will be described by partial differential equations. In order to design a controller for the column, it is needed a transfer function or a statespace realization of the plant, which is the main contribution of the present work. Implementing this mathematical model will be the key element for describing and understanding the operation of the plant and for future development of process control strategies.},

abstract = {CONTEXT:Phycocyanin (PC) has been proven to have many therapeutic properties, but its effects on diabetes have not been investigated.

OBJECTIVE:Antidiabetic activity of PC isolated from Spirulina platensis was evaluated in this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Oral administration of PC (100 mg/kg, once per day for 3 weeks) on KKAy mice were investigated by monitoring the changes in body weight, food intake, fasting plasma glucose level, 24 h random blood glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), glycosylated serum protein (GSP), fasting serum insulin (FINS), glycogen, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), total antioxidative capability (T-AOC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Histopathological changes in the pancreas were also examined with hematoxylin-eosin staining.

RESULTS:Administration of PC significantly decreased the body weight, fasting plasma glucose, 24 h random blood glucose levels, FINS and GSP levels, TG and TC content in serum and livers, MDA content in livers (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). On the other hand, glucose tolerance to glucose administration, T-AOC, and the content of glycogen in liver and muscle were enhanced following PC treatment (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Histopathological results showed that PC administration suppressed the abnormal enlargement of islets observed in the pancreas of KKAy mice.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:The antidiabetic effect of PC on KKAy mice is most likely due to its ability to enhance insulin sensitivity, amelioration of insulin resistance of peripheral target tissues and regulation of glucolipide metabolism. Therefore, PC may have a potential clinical utility in combating type-2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Scintillator doped with a high neutron-capture cross-section material can be used to detect neutrons via their resulting gamma rays. Examples of such detectors using liquid scintillator have been successfully used in high-energy physics experiments. However, a liquid scintillator can leak and is not as amenable to modular or complex shapes as a solid scintillator. Polystyrene-based scintillators from a variety of gadolinium compounds with varying concentrations were polymerized in our laboratory. The light output, emission spectra, and attenuation length of our samples were measured and light collection strategies using a wavelength shifting (WLS) fiber were evaluated. The measured optical parameters were used to tune a Geant4-based optical Monte Carlo, enabling the trapping efficiency to be calculated. This technology was also evaluated as a possible neutron veto for the direct detection dark matter experiment, Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SuperCDMS).},

A modulation of this signal is observed with a period of (366{\textpm}3) days and a relative amplitude of (1.29{\textpm}0.07)%. The measured phase is (179{\textpm}6) days, corresponding to a maximum on the 28th of June. Using the most complete atmospheric data models available, muon rate fluctuations are shown to be positively correlated with atmospheric temperature, with an effective coefficient $\alpha$T = 0.93{\textpm}0.04.

abstract = {Neutrons produced by cosmic muon interactions are important contributors to backgrounds in underground detectors when searching for rare events. Typically such neutrons can dominate the background, as they are particularly difficult to shield and detect. Since actual data is sparse and not well documented, simulation studies must be used to design shields and predict background rates. Thus validation of any simulation code is necessary to assure reliable results. This work compares in detail predictions of the FLUKA simulation code to existing data, and uses this code to report a simulation of cosmogenic backgrounds for typical detectors embedded in a water tank with liquid scintillator shielding.},

We report on studies of various $\ensuremath{\beta}$ and $\ensuremath{\gamma}$ backgrounds in the liquid-xenon-based EXO-$2000\ensuremath{\nu}\ensuremath{\beta}\ensuremath{\beta}$ experiment. With this work we try to better understand the location and strength of specific background sources and compare the conclusions to radioassay results taken before and during detector construction.

abstract = {Although the existence of dark matter is supported by many evidences, based on astrophysical measurements, its nature is still completely unknown. One major candidate is represented by weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which could in principle be detected through their collisions with ordinary nuclei in a sensitive target, producing observable low-energy ({\&}{\#}x3c;100{\&}{\#}x2009;keV) nuclear recoils. The DarkSide program aims at the WIPMs detection using a liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr-TPC). In this paper we quickly review the DarkSide program focusing in particular on the next generation experiment DarkSide-G2, a 3.6-ton LAr-TPC. The different detector components are described as well as the improvements needed to scale the detector from DarkSide-50 (50{\&}{\#}x2009;kg LAr-TPC) up to DarkSide-G2. Finally, the preliminary results on background suppression and expected sensitivity are presented.},

abstract = {The emission of particles from black holes created in the early Universe has detectable astrophysical consequences. The most stringent bound on their abundance has been obtained from the absence of a detectable diffuse flux of 100 MeV photons. Further scrutiny of these bounds is of interest as they, for instance, rule out primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We here point out that these bounds can, in principle, be improved by studying the diffuse cosmic neutrino flux. Measurements of near-vertical atmospheric neutrino fluxes in a region of low geomagnetic latitude can provide a competitive bound. The most favorable energy to detect a possible diffuse flux of primordial black hole origin is found to be a few MeV. We also show that measurements of the diffuse ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\mathrm{\ensuremath{\tau}}}$ flux is the most promising to improve the existing bounds deduced from \ensuremath{\gamma}-ray measurements. Neutrinos from individual black hole explosions can be detected in the GeV\char21{}TeV energy region. We find that the kilometer-scale detectors, recently proposed, are able to establish competitive bounds.},

The transport properties are the self diffusion coefficients, D 11, D 22; mututal diffusion coefficient, D 12; shear viscosity, $\eta$; bulk viscosity, $\kappa$; and thermal conductivity, $\lambda$. The fluids are assumed to be monoatomic, composed of Lennard-Jones 12{\textendash}6 particles. The mixture interactions between unlike atoms are treated by using the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules. In order to simulate all of the transport properties in a single simulation run the one fluid approximation is used. The state points for the binary mixtures are along an isotherm for different values of the concentration and density in reduced Lennard-Jones units (T* and $\rho$*). The mixtures temperatures are; argon-krypton, T = 115{\textperiodcentered}77 K, argon-xenon, T = 115{\textperiodcentered}77 K and krypton-xenon, T = 161{\textperiodcentered}36 K.

Typical relative volatilities of 32S/34S are 1.0023 for H2S, 0.9978 for SF4, 0.9985 for SF6, 1.0006 for COS, and 1.0011 for CH3SH. A 12C/13C volatility of 0.9982 was also seen in COS. Sulfur separations in SF4 and SF6 and the carbon separation in COS are reverse isotope effects. Distillation is a feasible method for sulfur isotope separation. Hydrogen sulfide is the best candidate compound for a practical sulfur isotope separation. Existing distillation columns could economically produce as much as 50 kg/yr of contained 34S at 15% enrichment. Smaller amounts of more highly enriched isotopes could also be produced.},

abstract = {One of the main factors limiting the precision of timing measurements with silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators is the dark noise, especially in the case of large devices. In order to cope with it, a suitable signal processing should be employed. The method we propose is called differential leading edge discriminator (DLED) and allows an effective compensation of the baseline fluctuations due to the dark counts of the detector. In this paper we show a comparison between the measurements obtained using the traditional Leading Edge Discriminator technique and the DLED. The improvement we observe is remarkable. Combining this baseline correction algorithm with low temperatures, we were able to reach a coincidence resolving time of 180 ps FWHM, using 4 mm {\&}{\#}x00D7; 4 mm SiPMs produced at FBK coupled to 3.8 mm {\&}{\#}x00D7; 3.8 mm {\&}{\#}x00D7; 5 mm Teflon-wrapped LYSO crystals.},

abstract = {A feasibility study was carried out to determine whether image quality can be improved by the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information in positron emission tomography (PET). The experiment used two fast cesium fluoride detectors followed by constant-fraction discriminators for coincidence-timing resolutions of 600 to 800 psec full width at half maximum, depending on the energy discrimination level. A point source was scanned to study the spatial response of the point spread function with and without the TOF information for nonfiltered back-projected data. Back-projected images of a simplified chest phantom, 42 cm in diameter and filled with relative activity concentrations of 1, 0, and 5, are presented for the unfiltered data to demonstrate the improvement in image quality obtained with the use of TOF. Filtered and reconstructed images of this phantom are also presented to show the relative differences in the images obtained with PET and TOF-PET techniques for similar filter functions.},

The enhanced ionizaiton yield (13% relative to the ionization yield in pure liquid Ar) is observed for Xe-doped (1.6%) liquid Ar and is attributed to the ionizing excitation transfer process from Ar excitons to doped Xe. The saturated value of the enhanced ionization is in good agreement with the theoretical value obtained under the assumption that the same electron band structure and the same exciton states as those in solid Ar exist in the liquid, too. This provides strong evidence for the existence of the exciton states in liquid Ar. No significant increase in ionization is observed with Kr-doped liquid Ar. The relaxation processes in liquid Ar are discussed.},

abstract = {We use LHC dijet data to derive constraints on neutrinoless double beta decay. Upper limits on cross sections for the production of ``exotic'' resonances, such as a right-handed $W$ boson or a diquark, can be converted into lower limits on the double beta decay half-life for fixed choices of other parameters. Constraints derived from run-I data are already surprisingly strong and complementary to results from searches using same-sign dileptons plus jets. For the case of the left-right symmetric model, in case no new resonance is found in future runs of the LHC and assuming ${g}_{L}={g}_{R}$, we estimate a lower limit on the double beta decay half-life larger than ${10}^{27}$ yr can be derived from future dijet data, except in the window of relatively light right-handed neutrino masses in the range 0.5 MeV to 50 GeV. Part of this mass window will be tested in the upcoming SHiP experiment. We also discuss current and future limits on possible scalar diquark contributions to double beta decay that can be derived from dijet data.},

abstract = {Amorphous selenium (a-Se) is a photoconductor used for both optical and x-ray imaging. Its optical photogeneration efficiency has been understood in terms of the Onsager theory of geminate recombination. However, x-ray photogeneration in a-Se has not been understood well. A previous argument has dismissed the Onsager theory of geminate recombination in the context of carrier generation in a-Se by high-energy radiation. Instead, columnar recombination has been proposed. In this paper we examine this argument and the predictions of the two recombination mechanisms. We find that the argument which dismissed the Onsager theory of geminate recombination is unwarranted, and that the Onsager theory is generally consistent with available experimental data. On the other hand, the columnar recombination theory is inconsistent with experiment. We have extended the Onsager theory in a form appropriate for x-ray photogeneration in a-Se to reflect that there should be a broad distribution of electron-hole separations.},

abstract = {Purpose: To estimate the radiation dose from whole-body fluorine 18 (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) studies and to evaluate the induced cancer risk to U.S. and Hong Kong populations. Materials and Methods: Fluorine 18{\textendash}FDG PET/CT studies obtained by using a 64-detector CT unit and one of three CT protocols were evaluated. CT protocol A consisted of 120 kV; rotation time, 0.5 second; pitch, 0.984; 100{\textendash}300 mA; and noise level, 20. CT protocol B was the same as A, except for a fixed tube current of 250 mA. CT protocol C consisted of 140 kV; rotation time, 0.5 second; pitch, 0.984; 150{\textendash}350 mA; and noise level, 3.5. CT doses were measured in a humanoid phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Doses from 18F-FDG PET scanning were estimated by multiplying the 18F-FDG radioactivity (370 MBq) with dose coefficients. Effective doses were calculated according to International Commission on Radiological Protection publication 103. Lifetime attribu...},

The data exhibit a zenith angle dependent deficit of muon neutrinos which is inconsistent with expectations based on calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. Experimental biases and uncertainties in the prediction of neutrino fluxes and cross sections are unable to explain our observation. The data are consistent, however, with two-flavor ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\mu}}\ensuremath{\leftrightarrow}{\ensuremath{\nu}}_{\ensuremath{\tau}}$ oscillations with ${sin}^{2}2\ensuremath{\theta}{\&}gt;0.82$ and $5\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}4}{\&}lt;\ensuremath{\Delta}{m}^{2}{\&}lt;6\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}1{0}^{\ensuremath{-}3}\mathrm{eV}{}^{2}$ at 90% confidence level.},

abstract = {Spirulina maxima is a filamentous cyanobacterium used as food supplement because of its high nutrient contents. It has been experimentally proven, in vivo and in vitro that posses several pharmacological properties. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Spirulina maxima orally supplied (4.5 g/day, for 6 weeks) to a sample of 36 subjects (16 men and 20 women, with ages between 18{\textendash}65 years) on serum lipids, glucose, aminotransferases and on blood pressure. The volunteers did not modify their dietary habits or lifestyle during the whole experimental period. From each subject, a sample of blood was drawn in fasting state of 12 hours to determi the plasma concentrations of glucose, triacylglycerols (TAG), total cholesterol (TC), cholesterol associated to high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Anthropometric measurements including systolic (SYST-P) and diastolic (DIAST-P) blood pressure, height, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) were also recorded. Comparing initial and final data, the results showed that there were no significant changes in the values of glucose and AST, but significant differences in TAG, TC, and HDL-C, were observed: TAG 233.7 {\textpm} 177.8 vs. 167.7 {\textpm} 100.7 mg/dL (p {\&}lt; 0.001), TC 181.7 {\textpm} 37.5 vs. 163.5 {\textpm} 34.4 mg/dL (p {\&}lt; 0.001), C-HDL 43.5 {\textpm} 14.4 vs. 50 {\textpm} 18.8 mg/dL (p {\&}lt; 0.01). The univariated analysis showed that the changes in the HDL-C and TC concentrations were dependent on TAG concentration (p = 0.247 and p = 0.108, respectively); nevertheless the calculated values for cholesterol associated to low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) were significantly reduced by the Spirulina maxima treatment but independently of the TAG changes. In addition, significant differences were found comparing initial and final SYST-P and DIAST-P blood pressure in both male and female: SYST-P male 121 {\textpm} 9 vs. 111 {\textpm} 8 mm Hg (p {\&}lt; 0.01), DIAST-P male 85 {\textpm} 6.5 vs. 77 {\textpm} 9 mm Hg (p {\&}lt; 0.01); SYST-P female 120 {\textpm} 9.5 vs. 109 {\textpm} 11 mm Hg (p {\&}lt; 0.002), DIAST-P female 85 {\textpm} 11 vs. 79 {\textpm} 7.5 mm Hg (p {\&}lt; 0.03). The Spirulina maxima showed a hypolipemic effect, especially on the TAG and the LDL-C concentrations but indirectly on TC and HDL-C values. It also reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure.},

abstract = {A key enabling technology for many liquid noble gas (LNG) detectors is the use of the common wavelength shifting medium Tetraphenyl Butadiene (TPB). TPB thin films are used to shift ultraviolet scintillation light into the visible spectrum for detection and event reconstruction. Understanding the wavelength shifting efficiency (WLSE) and emission spectrum are critical aspects in detector performance and modeling and hence in the ultimate physics sensitivity of such experiments. This article presents results for the WLSE and emission spectrum in the range 50 - 250 nm, more precise and across a broader spectrum of wavelengths than previous results. The low-wavelength sensitivity would allow construction of LNG scintillator detectors with lighter elements (Ne, He) to target light mass WIMPs. This article also presents the first ever extraction of the true underlying quantum efficiency of TPB, a result that is independent of film-specific properties.},

This cosmic-shear technique is based on the measurement of the weak distortions that lensing induces in the shape of background galaxies as photons travel through large-scale structures. This technique is now widely used to measure the mass distribution of galaxy clusters and has recently been detected in random regions of the sky. In this review, we present the theory and observational status of cosmic shear. We describe the principles of weak lensing and the predictions for the shear statistics in favored cosmological models. Next, we review the current measurements of cosmic shear and show how they constrain cosmological parameters. We then describe the prospects offered by upcoming and future cosmic-shear surveys as well as the technical challenges that have to be met for the promises of cosmic shear to be fully realized.},

Following a detailed study to establish the stability of the detector and its background contributions during this run, we performed an unbinned profile likelihood analysis to identify any periodicity up to 500 days. We find a global significance of less than $1\ensuremath{\sigma}$ for all periods, suggesting no statistically significant modulation in the data. While the local significance for an annual modulation is $2.8\ensuremath{\sigma}$, the analysis of a multiple-scatter control sample and the phase of the modulation disfavor a dark matter interpretation. The DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation interpreted as a dark matter signature with axial-vector coupling of weakly interacting massive particles to electrons is excluded at $4.8\ensuremath{\sigma}$.},

abstract = {The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0{$\nu$}{$\beta$}{$\beta$}) would show that lepton number is violated, reveal that neutrinos are Majorana particles, and provide information on neutrino mass. A discovery-capable experiment covering the inverted ordering region, with effective Majorana neutrino masses of 15 - 50 meV, will require a tonne-scale experiment with excellent energy resolution and extremely low backgrounds, at the level of 0.1 count /(FWHMtyr) in the region of the signal. The current generation 76Ge experiments GERDA and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR utilizing high purity Germanium detectors with an intrinsic energy resolution of 0.12%, have achieved the lowest backgrounds by over an order of magnitude in the 0{$\nu$}{$\beta$}{$\beta$} signal region of all 0{$\nu$}{$\beta$}{$\beta$} experiments. Building on this success, the LEGEND collaboration has been formed to pursue a tonne-scale 76Ge experiment. The collaboration aims to develop a phased 0{$\nu$}{$\beta$}{$\beta$} experimental program with discovery potential at a half-life approaching or at 1028 years, using existing resources as appropriate to expedite physics results.},

These detectors rely on the capabilities to assemble large volumes of LAr in ultrahigh-purity conditions, possibly in an underground environment, and to achieve relatively long drifts for the ionization charge. Several proposals have been developed, each of which takes a different approach to the design of the cryogenic vessels and has different scales of modularity to reach the final mass dictated by physics. New detector concepts, with innovative designs of readout electronics and novel methods for the readout of the ionization charge and scintillation light, have been proposed.},

abstract = {The scattering cross section of gaseous argon as a function of electron energy (2-300 meV) has been redetermined from the temperature dependence of the thermal electron mobility ${\ensuremath{\mu}}_{\mathrm{th}}$. The cross section at $\ensuremath{\epsilon}{\&}lt;10$ meV is larger than previously reported. The threshold drift velocity above which electron heating occurs is ${v}_{d}^{\mathrm{thr}}\ensuremath{\approx}100$ m/s in the low-density gas at 121 K; the ratio of ${v}_{d}^{\mathrm{thr}}$ to the speed of sound is $\frac{{v}_{d}^{\mathrm{thr}}}{c}\ensuremath{\approx}0.5$, characteristic of energy loss by elastic collisions. In the dense gas at $\frac{n}{{n}_{c}}\ensuremath{\gtrsim}0.2$, where ${n}_{c}$ is the critical density: (1) the value of $n{\ensuremath{\mu}}_{\mathrm{th}}$ increases; (2) the maximum in the plot of $\ensuremath{\mu}n$ against field strength $\frac{E}{n}$ shifts to lower $\frac{E}{n}$; (3) the temperature coefficient of ${\ensuremath{\mu}}_{\mathrm{th}}$ at constant density increases. (1) is due to the mutual screening of the attractive, long-range scattering interactions; (2) is due to (1) and the constant "saturation" drift velocity; (3) is due to quasilocalization of the electrons. Quasilocalization or enhanced scattering in the coexistence vapor and liquid is significant at $0.2\ensuremath{\lesssim}\frac{n}{{n}_{c}}\ensuremath{\lesssim}1.6$, and maximizes near $\frac{n}{{n}_{c}}=0.6$. Quasilocalization occurs to a smaller extent in argon than in xenon at the same $\frac{n}{{n}_{c}}$ and $\frac{T}{{T}_{c}}$. The low-energy wing of the Ramsauer-Townsend effect is obliterated by screening at $n\ensuremath{\ge}1.0\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{22}$ molecule/${\mathrm{cm}}^{3}$ in both argon and xenon, which corresponds to $\frac{n}{{n}_{c}}=1.2$ in the former and 2.0 in the latter.

abstract = {SuperCDMS SNOLAB will be a next-generation experiment aimed at directly detecting low-mass particles (with masses $\ensuremath{\le}10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$) that may constitute dark matter by using cryogenic detectors of two types (HV and iZIP) and two target materials (germanium and silicon). The experiment is being designed with an initial sensitivity to nuclear recoil cross sections $\ensuremath{\sim}1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}43}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ for a dark matter particle mass of $1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$, and with capacity to continue exploration to both smaller masses and better sensitivities. The phonon sensitivity of the HV detectors will be sufficient to detect nuclear recoils from sub-GeV dark matter. A detailed calibration of the detector response to low-energy recoils will be needed to optimize running conditions of the HV detectors and to interpret their data for dark matter searches. Low-activity shielding, and the depth of SNOLAB, will reduce most backgrounds, but cosmogenically produced $^{3}\mathrm{H}$ and naturally occurring $^{32}\mathrm{Si}$ will be present in the detectors at some level. Even if these backgrounds are 10 times higher than expected, the science reach of the HV detectors would be over 3 orders of magnitude beyond current results for a dark matter mass of $1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$. The iZIP detectors are relatively insensitive to variations in detector response and backgrounds, and will provide better sensitivity for dark matter particles with masses $\ensuremath{\gtrsim}5\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$. The mix of detector types (HV and iZIP), and targets (germanium and silicon), planned for the experiment, as well as flexibility in how the detectors are operated, will allow us to maximize the low-mass reach, and understand the backgrounds that the experiment will encounter. Upgrades to the experiment, perhaps with a variety of ultra-low-background cryogenic detectors, will extend dark matter sensitivity down to the ``neutrino floor,'' where coherent scatters of solar neutrinos become a limiting background.},

abstract = {The LZ experiment, featuring a 7-tonne active liquid xenon target, is aimed at achieving unprecedented sensitivity to WIMPs with the background expected to be dominated by astrophysical neutrinos. To reach this goal, extensive simulations are carried out to accurately calculate the electron recoil and nuclear recoil rates in the detector. Both internal (from target material) and external (from detector components and surrounding environment) backgrounds are considered. A very efficient suppression of background rate is achieved with an outer liquid scintillator veto, liquid xenon skin and fiducialisation. Based on the current measurements of radioactivity of different materials, it is shown that LZ can achieve the reduction of a total background for a WIMP search down to about 2 events in 1000 live days for 5.6 tonne fiducial mass.},

TPB emanation from each coating is quantified by fluorescence assay of molecular seive filter material after a prolonged soak time. Two of the coatings are shown to emanate a detectable concentration of TPB into argon over a 24 hour period, which corresponds to tens of parts per billion in argon by mass. In an independent setup, the dissolved or suspended TPB is shown to produce a wavelength shifting effect in the argon bulk which has at least two long, characteristic time constants of 0.950.05{\textasciitilde}ms and 17.8 2.0 ms. Interpretations of these results and implications for present and future liquid argon time projection chamber experiments are discussed.},

abstract = {In this work, we present the concept for large low-background experiments in which an unusual gas mixture gas serves as a seamless, high-QE, near-100%-coverage photodetector for scintillation or  photons. We fill a large time projection chamber with a VUV scintillating gas, plus an unusually small admixture dopant gas with a low ionization threshhold (and a high ionization yield), akin to a highly-underquenched Penning mixture. Scintillation photons travel far from a primary ionization site before converting into photoionization electrons. Using standard TPC methods, we can separately count both the primary ionization electrons (which occur along a dense track) and the scintillation-ionization electrons (which will occur over a large spherical region) without the use of PMTs. The scheme is compatible with very large detectors, in both two-phase and single-phase high pressure configurations. We discuss how the drift-axis position of an event can be reconstructed, and under what constraints we can expect stable gas gain operations. We propose some detectors illustrating how this scheme---both in conventional two-phase geometries, as well as in pressurized space in solution-mined salt cavern---makes it possible to safely construct gas time projection chambers of previously-unreachable target masses, capable of studying dark matter, double beta decay, proton decay, and solar neutrinos; more speculative gas mixtures might extend the technique to reactor and geoneutrinos},

A low energy detection threshold is essential for a sensitive WIMP search.

In this article, we present new measurements that extend the energy down to 4 keV, finding that ${\mathcal{L}}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ decreases with decreasing energy. We also measure the quenching of scintillation efficiency caused by the electric field in LXe, finding no significant field dependence.},

abstract = {Solar neutrinos from ${}^{8}\mathrm{B}$ decay have been detected at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory via the charged current (CC) reaction on deuterium and the elastic scattering (ES) of electrons. The flux of ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e}$'s is measured by the CC reaction rate to be ${\ensuremath{\varphi}}^{\mathrm{CC}}({\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e})\phantom{\rule{0ex}{0ex}}=\phantom{\rule{0ex}{0ex}}1.75\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.07(\mathrm{stat}{)}_{\ensuremath{-}0.11}^{+0.12}(\mathrm{syst})\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}0.05(\mathrm{theor})\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{6}{\mathrm{cm}}^{\ensuremath{-}2}{\mathrm{s}}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$. Comparison of ${\ensuremath{\varphi}}^{\mathrm{CC}}({\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e})$ to the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration's precision value of the flux inferred from the ES reaction yields a $3.3\ensuremath{\sigma}$ difference, assuming the systematic uncertainties are normally distributed, providing evidence of an active non- ${\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e}$ component in the solar flux.

abstract = {A robust signal for sidereal anisotropy in nuclear recoils would support, perhaps more decisively than any other evidence, a discovery claim for a WIMP component of Dark Matter. I present a concept based on columnar recombination in dense xenon gas, sensing nuclear recoil direction relative to a TPC drift field. The central advance is that nuclear recoil directionality information is obtained through a comparison, event-by-event, of the ionization signal and recombination signal that are produced prior to drifting the track ionization. The optimum xenon density for this concept may be near ten bars, unlike conventional techniques that employ track visualization {\textendash} with severe restrictions on gas density to about 1/10 bar. No restriction is imposed by diffusion during drift, facilitating the realization of a large monolithic room temperature xenon gas Time Projection Chamber at the ton-scale, with unprecedented sensitivity for both directionality and cross-section. Remarkably, the desired operating conditions for 0-$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$ 136Xe experiment may be identical.},

The isotopic enrichment in 82Se, the Zn82Se crystals growth, as well as the light detectors production have been accomplished, and the experiment is now in construction at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Italy). In this paper we present the results obtained testing the first three Zn82Se crystals operated as scintillating bolometers, and we prove that their performance in terms of energy resolution, background rejection capability and intrinsic radio-purity complies with the requirements of CUPID-0.},

abstract = {We present an updated calculation of the uncertainties on the atmospheric muon-neutrino flux arising from cosmic-ray primaries. For the first time, we include recent measurements of the cosmic-ray primaries collected since 2005. We apply a statistical technique that allows the determination of correlations between the parameters of the Gaisser, Stanev, Honda, and Lipari primary-flux parametrization and the incorporation of these correlations into the uncertainty on the muon-neutrino flux. We obtain an uncertainty related to the primary cosmic rays of around (5--15)%, depending on energy, which is about a factor of 2 smaller than the previously determined uncertainty. The hadron production uncertainty is added in quadrature to obtain the total uncertainty on the neutrino flux, which is reduced by $\ensuremath{\approx}5%$. To take into account an unexpected hardening of the spectrum of primaries above energies of 100 GeV observed in recent measurements, we propose an alternative parametrization and discuss its impact on the neutrino flux uncertainties.},

The excess second virial coefficients were reproduced usually within 0.1 cc/mole by measuring the pressure change of mixing two pure gases at constant temperature and volume. With these excess quantities and literature values of B11, the interaction second virial coefficients were calculated. The comparison between experimental interaction second virial coefficients and those calculated by the Kihara potential was considered good at the higher temperatures and fair to poor at the lower temperatures where the deviation was sometimes as much as 8 cc/mole. This deviation is probably mainly due to the assumption of the geometric-mean mixing rule for the characteristic energy between the dissimilar molecules.

This Phase II trial enrolled patients with complicated vascular anomalies to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with sirolimus for 12 courses; each course was defined as 28 days.</p><h3>METHODS:</h3> <p>Treatment consisted of a continuous dosing schedule of oral sirolimus starting at 0.8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per dose twice daily, with pharmacokinetic-guided target serum trough levels of 10 to 15 ng/mL. The primary outcomes were responsiveness to sirolimus by the end of course 6 (evaluated according to functional impairment score, quality of life, and radiologic assessment) and the incidence of toxicities and/or infection<b>-</b>related deaths.</p><h3>RESULTS:</h3> <p>Sixty-one patients were enrolled; 57 patients were evaluable for efficacy at the end of course 6, and 53 were evaluable at the end of course 12. No patient had a complete response at the end of course 6 or 12 as anticipated. At the end of course 6, a total of 47 patients had a partial response, 3 patients had stable disease, and 7 patients had progressive disease. Two patients were taken off of study medicine secondary to persistent adverse effects. Grade 3 and higher toxicities attributable to sirolimus included blood/bone marrow toxicity in 27% of patients, gastrointestinal toxicity in 3%, and metabolic/laboratory toxicity in 3%. No toxicity-related deaths occurred.</p><h3>CONCLUSIONS:</h3> <p>Sirolimus was efficacious and well tolerated in these study patients with complicated vascular anomalies. Clinical activity was reported in the majority of the disorders.</p>},

The distillation column is designed to accept a mixture of argon, helium, and nitrogen and return pure argon with a nitrogen contamination less than 10 ppm. In the first commissioning, we were able to run the distillation column in a continuous mode and produce argon that is 99.9% pure. After running in a batch mode, the argon purity was increased to 99.95%, with 500 ppm of nitrogen remaining. The efficiency of collecting the argon from the gas mixture was between 70% and 81%, at an argon production rate of 0.84-0.98 kg/day.},

abstract = {Several possible background sources determine the detectability of pep and CNO solar neutrinos in organic liquid scintillator detectors. Among such sources, the cosmogenic $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ nuclide plays a central role. $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ is produced underground in reactions induced by the residual cosmic muon flux. Experimental data available for the effective cross section for $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ by muons indicate that $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ will be the dominant source of background for the observation of pep and CNO neutrinos. $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ decays are expected to total a rate 2.5 (20) times higher than the combined rate of pep and CNO neutrinos in Borexino (KamLAND) in the energy window preferred for the pep measurement between 0.8 and 1.3 MeV. This study examines the production mechanism of $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ by muon-induced showers in organic liquid scintillators with a novel approach: for the first time, we perform a detailed ab initio calculation of the production of a cosmogenic nuclide, $^{11}\mathrm{C}$, taking into consideration all relevant production channels. Results of the calculation are compared with the effective cross sections measured by target experiments in muon beams. This article also discusses a technique for reduction of background from $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ in organic liquid scintillator detectors, which allows to identify on a one-by-one basis and remove from the data set a large fraction of $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ decays. The background reduction technique hinges on an idea proposed by Martin Deutsch, who suggested that a neutron must be ejected in every interaction producing a $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ nuclide from $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ events are tagged by a threefold coincidence with the parent muon track and the subsequent neutron capture on protons.},

abstract = {Yttrium-90 (90Y) radioembolization involves the intra-arterial delivery of radioactive microspheres to treat hepatic malignancies. Though this therapy involves careful pre-treatment planning and imaging, little is known about the precise location of the microspheres once they are administered. Recently, there has been growing interest post-radioembolization imaging using positron-emission tomography (PET) for quantitative dosimetry and identifying lesions that may benefit from additional salvage therapy. In this study, we aim to measure the inter-center variability of 90Y PET measurements as measured on PET/MRI in preparation for a multi-institutional prospective phase I/II clinical trial. Eight institutions participated in this study and followed a standardized phantom filling and imaging protocol. The NEMA NU2-2012 body phantom was filled with 3{\&}nbsp;GBq of 90Y chloride solution. The phantom was imaged for 30{\&}nbsp;min in listmode on a Siemens Biograph mMR non-TOF PET/MRI scanner at five time points across 10{\&}nbsp;days (0.3{\textendash}3.0{\&}nbsp;GBq). Raw PET data were sent to a central site for image reconstruction and data analysis. Images were reconstructed with optimal parameters determined from a previous study. Volumes of interest (VOIs) matching the known sphere diameters were drawn on the vendor-provided attenuation map and propagated to the PET images. Recovery coefficients (RCs) and coefficient of variation of the RCs (COV) were calculated from these VOIs for each sphere size and activity level. Mean RCs ranged from 14.5 to 75.4%, with the lowest mean RC coming from the smallest sphere (10{\&}nbsp;mm) on the last day of imaging (0.16{\&}nbsp;MBq/ml) and the highest mean RC coming from the largest sphere (37{\&}nbsp;mm) on the first day of imaging (2.16{\&}nbsp;MBq/ml). The smaller spheres tended to exhibit higher COVs. In contrast, the larger spheres tended to exhibit lower COVs. COVs from the 37{\&}nbsp;mm sphere were {\&}lt; 25.3% in all scans. For scans with $\ge$ 0.60{\&}nbsp;MBq/ml, COVs were $\le$ 25% in spheres $\ge$ 22{\&}nbsp;mm. However, for all other spheres sizes and activity levels, COVs were usually {\&}gt; 25%. Post-radioembolization dosimetry of lesions or other VOIs $\ge$ 22{\&}nbsp;mm in diameter can be consistently obtained ({\&}lt; 25% variability) at a multi-institutional level using PET/MRI for any clinically significant activity for 90Y radioembolization.},

abstract = {In gastroenterological practice, breath tests (BTs) are diagnostic tools used for indirect, non-invasive assessment of several pathophysiological metabolic processes, by monitoring the appearance in breath of a metabolite of a specific substrate. Labelled substrates originally employed radioactive carbon 14 ((14)C) and, more recently, the stable carbon 13 isotope ((13)C) has been introduced to label specific substrates. The ingested (13)C-substrate is metabolized, and exhaled (13)CO2 is measured by mass spectrometry or infrared spectroscopy. Some (13)C-BTs evaluate specific (microsomal, cytosolic, and mitochondrial) hepatic metabolic pathways and can be employed in liver diseases (i.e. simple liver steatosis, non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, drug and alcohol effects). Another field of clinical application for (13)C-BTs is the assessment of gastric emptying kinetics in response to liquids ((13)C-acetate) or solids ((13)C-octanoic acid in egg yolk or in a pre-packed muffin or the (13)C-Spirulina platensis given with a meal or a biscuit). Studies have shown that (13)C-BTs, used for gastric emptying studies, yield results that are comparable to scintigraphy and can be useful in detecting either delayed- (gastroparesis) or accelerated gastric emptying or changes of gastric kinetics due to pharmacological effects. Thus, (13)C-BTs represent an indirect, cost-effective and easy method of evaluating dynamic liver function and gastric kinetics in health and disease, and several other potential applications are being studied.},

abstract = {2-[(18)F]Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) assesses a fundamental property of neoplasia, the Warburg effect. This molecular imaging technique offers a complementary approach to anatomic imaging that is more sensitive and specific in certain cancers. FDG-PET has been widely applied in oncology primarily as a staging and restaging tool that can guide patient care. However, because it accurately detects recurrent or residual disease, FDG-PET also has significant potential for assessing therapy response. In this regard, it can improve patient management by identifying responders early, before tumor size is reduced; nonresponders could discontinue futile therapy. Moreover, a reduction in the FDG-PET signal within days or weeks of initiating therapy (e.g., in lymphoma, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancer) significantly correlates with prolonged survival and other clinical end points now used in drug approvals. These findings suggest that FDG-PET could facilitate drug development as an early surrogate of clinical benefit. This article reviews the scientific basis of FDG-PET and its development and application as a valuable oncology imaging tool. Its potential to facilitate drug development in seven oncologic settings (lung, lymphoma, breast, prostate, sarcoma, colorectal, and ovary) is addressed. Recommendations include initial validation against approved therapies, retrospective analyses to define the magnitude of change indicative of response, further prospective validation as a surrogate of clinical benefit, and application as a phase II/III trial end point to accelerate evaluation and approval of novel regimens and therapies.},

abstract = {We report an absolute calibration of the ionization yields({Q_y}) and fluctuations for electronic recoil events in liquid xenon at discrete energies between 186 eV and 33.2 keV. The average electric field applied across the liquid xenon target is 180 V/cm. The data are obtained using low energy 127Xe electron capture decay events from the 95.0-day first run from LUX (WS2013) in search of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The sequence of gamma-ray and X-ray cascades associated with 127I de-excitations produces clearly identified 2-vertex events in the LUX detector. We observe the K- (binding energy, 33.2 keV), L- (5.2 keV), M- (1.1 keV), and N- (186 eV) shell cascade events and verify that the relative ratio of observed events for each shell agrees with calculations. The N-shell cascade analysis includes single extracted electron (SE) events and represents the lowest-energy electronic recoil in situ measurements that have been explored in liquid xenon.},

abstract = {In June 2012, an Expression of Interest for a long-baseline experiment (LBNO) has been submitted to the CERN SPSC. LBNO considers three types of neutrino detector technologies: a double-phase liquid argon (LAr) TPC and a magnetised iron detector as far detectors. For the near detector, a high-pressure gas TPC embedded in a calorimeter and a magnet is the baseline design. A mandatory milestone is a concrete prototyping effort towards the envisioned large-scale detectors, and an accompanying campaign of measurements aimed at assessing the detector associated systematic errors. The proposed 6 6 6m3 DLAr is an industrial prototype of the design discussed in the EoI and scalable to 20 kton or 50{\textasciitilde}kton. It is to be constructed and operated in a controlled laboratory and surface environment with test beam access, such as the CERN North Area (NA). Its successful operation and full characterisation will be a fundamental milestone, likely opening the path to an underground deployment of larger detectors. The response of the DLAr demonstrator will be measured and understood with an unprecedented precision in a charged particle test beam (0.5-20 GeV/c). The exposure will certify the assumptions and calibrate the response of the detector, and allow to develop and to benchmark sophisticated reconstruction algorithms, such as those of 3-dimensional tracking, particle ID and energy flow in liquid argon. All these steps are fundamental for validating the correctness of the physics performance described in the LBNO EoI.},

abstract = {We have exposed a dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber (LAr-TPC) to a low energy pulsed narrow-band neutron beam, produced at the Notre Dame Institute for Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics, to study the scintillation light yield of recoiling nuclei. Liquid scintillation counters were arranged to detect and identify neutrons scattered in the LAr-TPC and to select the energy of the recoiling nuclei. We report the observation of a significant dependence (up to 32%) on the drift field of liquid argon scintillation from nuclear recoils of energies between 10.8 and 49.9 keV. The field dependence is stronger at lower energies. Since it is the first measurement of such an effect in liquid argon, this observation is important because, to date, estimates of the sensitivity of LAr-TPC dark matter searches are based on the assumption that the electric field has only a small effect on the light yield from nuclear recoils.},

The amount of ionization produced in a detector medium is measured by the heat generated as the charged carriers are drifted across the device under an applied voltage. The amount of energy generated can be orders of magnitude larger than that deposited by the radiation itself. A dramatic increase in detector mass can be achieved compared to simple calorimetric particle detectors for equivalent energy thresholds. It is possible to obtain a sensitivity level sufficient for single-carrier detection. The principle of operation has been demonstrated with an experimental device operated at a temperature of 1.8 K, and improved performance is expected at lower temperatures.},

abstract = {We study in detail sub-GeV dark matter scattering off electrons in xenon, including the expected electron recoil spectra and annual modulation spectra. We derive improved constraints using low-energy XENON10 and XENON100 ionization-only data. For XENON10, in addition to including electron-recoil data corresponding to about 1\char21{}3 electrons, we include for the first time events corresponding to about 4\char21{}7 electrons. Assuming the scattering is momentum independent (${F}_{\mathrm{DM}}=1$), this strengthens a previous cross-section bound by almost an order of magnitude for dark matter masses above 50 MeV. The available XENON100 data corresponds to events with about 4\char21{}50 electrons, and leads to a constraint that is comparable to the XENON10 bound above 50 MeV for ${F}_{\mathrm{DM}}=1$. We demonstrate that a search for an annual modulation signal in upcoming xenon experiments (XENON1T, XENONnT, LZ) could substantially improve the above bounds even in the presence of large backgrounds. We also emphasize that in simple benchmark models of sub-GeV dark matter, the dark matter-electron scattering rate can be as high as one event every ten (two) seconds in the XENON1T (XENONnT or LZ) experiments, without being in conflict with any other known experimental bounds. While there are several sources of backgrounds that can produce single- or few-electron events, a large event rate can be consistent with a dark matter signal and should not be simply written off as purely a detector curiosity. This fact motivates a detailed analysis of the ionization-data (``S2'') data, taking into account the expected annual modulation spectrum of the signal rate, as well as the DM-induced electron-recoil spectra, which are another powerful discriminant between signal and background.},

abstract = {The DEAP-3600 experiment is searching for WIMP dark matter with a 3.3 tonne single phase liquid argon (LAr) target, located 2.1 km underground at SNOLAB. The experimental signature of dark matter interactions is keV-scale 40Ar nuclear recoils (NR) producing 128 nm LAr scintillation photons observed by PMTs. The largest backgrounds in DEAP-3600 are electronic recoils (ER) induced by $\beta$ and $\gamma$-rays originating from internal and external radioactivity in the detector material. A background model of the ER interactions in DEAP-3600 was developed and is described in this work. The model is based on several components which are expected from radioisotopes in the LAr, from ex-situ material assay measurements, and from dedicated independent in-situ analyses. This prior information is used in a Bayesian fit of the ER components to a 247.2 d dataset to model the radioactivity in the surrounding detector materials. While excellent discrimination between ERs and NRs is reached with pulse shape discrimination, utilizing the large difference between fast and slow components of LAr scintillation light, detailed knowledge of the ER background and activity of detector components, sets valuable constraints on other key types of backgrounds in the detector: neutrons and alphas. In addition, the activity of 42Ar in LAr in DEAP-3600 is determined by measuring the daughter decay of 42K. This cosmogenically activated trace isotope is a relevant background at higher energies for other rare event searches using atmospheric argon e.g. DarkSide-20k, GERDA or LEGEND. The specific activity of 42Ar in the atmosphere is found to be 40.4  5.9 $\mu$Bq/kg of argon.},

In combination, this makes PEN a very promising candidate as a self-vetoing structural material in low background experiments. Components instrumented with light detectors could be built from PEN.

abstract = {We calculate the electronic stopping power and the corresponding straggling for ions of arbitrary charge number, penetrating matter at any relativistic energy. The stopping powers are calculated by a simple method. Its starting point is the deviation of the precise theory from first-order quantum perturbation. We show that this deviation can be expressed in terms of the transport cross section, ${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\sigma}}}_{\mathrm{tr}}$, for scattering of a free electron by the ion. In the nonrelativistic case the deviation is precisely the Bloch correction to Bethe's formula; we look into the nonrelativistic case in order to clarify both some features of our method and a seeming paradox in Rutherford scattering. The corresponding relativistic correction is obtained from ${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\sigma}}}_{\mathrm{tr}}$ for scattering of a Dirac electron in the ion potential. Here, the major practical advantage of the method shows up; we need not find the scattering distribution, but merely a single quantity, ${\mathrm{\ensuremath{\sigma}}}_{\mathrm{tr}}$, determined by differences of successive phase shifts. For a point nucleus our results improve and extend those of Ahlen. Our final results, however, are based on atomic nuclei with standard radii. Thereby, the stopping is changed substantially already for moderate values of \ensuremath{\gamma}=(1-${\mathit{v}}^{2}$/${\mathit{c}}^{2}$${)}^{\mathrm{\ensuremath{-}}1/2}$. An asymptotic saturation in stopping is obtained. Because of finite nuclear size, recoil corrections remain negligible at all energies. The average square fluctuation in energy loss is calculated as a simple fluctuation cross section for a free electron. The fluctuation in the relativistic case is generally larger than that of the perturbation formula, by a factor of \ensuremath{\sim}2\char21{}3 for heavy ions. But the finite nuclear radius leads to a strong reduction at high energies and the elimination of the factor ${\ensuremath{\gamma}}^{2}$ belonging to point nuclei. \textcopyright{}1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {CUPID is a proposed future ton-scale bolometric neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\beta$$\beta$) experiment to probe the Majorana nature of neutrinos and discover Lepton Number Violation in the so-called inverted hierarchy region of the neutrino mass. CUPID will be built on experience, expertise and lessons learned in CUORE, and will exploit the current CUORE infrastructure as much as possible. In order to achieve its ambitious science goals, CUPID aims to increase the source mass and dramatically reduce the backgrounds in the region of interest. This requires isotopic enrichment, upgraded purification and crystallization procedures, new detector technologies, a stricter material selection, and possibly new shielding concepts with respect to the state of the art deployed in CUORE. This document reviews the science goals of CUPID, defines the scope for the near-term R{\&}D activities, and presents a roadmap towards mounting this next-generation experiment. A separate document discusses the extensive R{\&}D program in more detail.},

abstract = {Angular sensitivity can provide a key additional tool which might allow unambiguous separation of a signal due to galactic halo WIMPs from other possible backgrounds in direct detectors. We provide a formalism that allows a calculation of the expected angular distribution of events in terrestrial detectors with angular sensitivity for any incident distribution of galactic halo dark matter. This can be used as an input when studying the sensitivity of specific detectors to halo WIMPs. We utilize this formalism to examine the expected signature for WIMP dark matter using a variety of existing analytic halo models in order to explore how uncertainty in the galactic halo distribution impact on the the event rates that may be required to separate a possible WIMP signal from terrestrial backgrounds. We find that as few as 30 events might be required to disentangle the signal from backgrounds if the WIMP distribution resembles an isothermal sphere distribution. On the other hand, for certain halo distributions, even detectors with fine angular resolution may require in excess of a 100\char21{}400 events to distinguish a WIMP signal from backgrounds using angular sensitivity. We also note that for finite thresholds the different energy dependence of spin-dependent scattering cross sections may require a greater number of events to discern a WIMP signal than for spin independent interactions. Finally, we briefly describe ongoing studies aimed at developing strategies to better exploit angular signatures, and the use of N-body simulations to better model the expected halo distribution in predicting the expected signature for direct WIMP detectors.},

A theoretical solution to this paradox locates the missing baryons in the hot and tenuous filamentary gas between galaxies, known as the warm{\textendash}hot intergalactic medium. However, it is difficult to detect them there because the largest by far constituent of this gas{\textemdash}hydrogen{\textemdash}is mostly ionized and therefore almost invisible in far-ultraviolet spectra with typical signal-to-noise ratios8,9. Indeed, despite large observational efforts, only a few marginal claims of detection have been made so far2,10. Here we report observations of two absorbers of highly ionized oxygen (O~vii) in the high-signal-to-noise-ratio X-ray spectrum of a quasar at a redshift higher than 0.4. These absorbers show no variability over a two-year timescale and have no associated cold absorption, making the assumption that they originate from the quasar{\textquoteright}s intrinsic outflow or the host galaxy{\textquoteright}s interstellar medium implausible. The O~vii systems lie in regions characterized by large (four times larger than average 11 ) galaxy overdensities and their number (down to the sensitivity threshold of our data) agrees well with numerical simulation predictions for the long-sought warm{\textendash}hot intergalactic medium. We conclude that the missing baryons have been found.},

abstract = {Since the energy loss of a slow heavy particle is due predominantly to recoiling atoms, ionization by secondary heavy particles contributes a large fraction of the total ionization resulting from a slow heavy particle that is stopped in a gas. If the secondary heavy particle ionization efficiency is low, the over-all efficiency for the production of ion pairs is greatly reduced for low energies of the primary particle. The secondary heavy particle ionization efficiency satisfies an integro-differential equation in which the ratio of electronic to atomic stopping cross sections plays a critical role. Data by Madsen on the ionization by recoiling particles in alpha-decay are used to set limits on the ionization by slow argon particles in argon, from which it is possible to make crude estimates of the energy of fission fragments which fails to give rise to ionization at the usual rate. In argon, ionization defects of the order of several Mev are to be expected.},

abstract = {SNO+ is a large liquid scintillator-based experiment located 2 km underground at SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada. It reuses the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory detector, consisting of a 12 m diameter acrylic vessel which will be filled with about 780 tonnes of ultra-pure liquid scintillator. Designed as a multipurpose neutrino experiment, the primary goal of SNO+ is a search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay (0) of 130Te. In Phase I, the detector will be loaded with 0.3% natural tellurium, corresponding to nearly 800 kg of 130Te, with an expected effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity in the region of 55{\textendash}133 meV, just above the inverted mass hierarchy. Recently, the possibility of deploying up to ten times more natural tellurium has been investigated, which would enable SNO+ to achieve sensitivity deep into the parameter space for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in the future. Additionally, SNO+ aims to measure reactor antineutrino oscillations, low energy solar neutrinos, and geoneutrinos, to be sensitive to supernova neutrinos, and to search for exotic physics. A first phase with the detector filled with water will begin soon, with the scintillator phase expected to start after a few months of water data taking. The Phase I is foreseen for 2017.},

abstract = {Tetraphenyl-butadiene is the wavelength shifter most widely used in combination with liquid argon. The latter emits scintillation photons with a wavelength of 127 nm that need to be downshifted to be detected by photomultipliers with glass or quartz windows. Tetraphenyl-butadiene has been demonstrated to have an extremely high conversion efficiency, possibly higher than 100% for 127 nm photons, while there is no precise information about the time dependence of its emission. It is usually assumed to be exponentially decaying with a characteristic time of the order of one ns, as an extrapolation from measurements with exciting radiation in the near UV. This work shows that tetraphenyl-butadiene, when excited by 127 nm photons, re-emits photons not only with a very short decay time, but also with slower ones due to triplet states de-excitations. This fact can strongly contribute to clarifying the anomalies in liquid-argon scintillation light reported in the literature since the 1970s, namely, the inconsistency in the measured values of the long decay time constant and the appearance of an intermediate component. Similar effects should be also expected when the TPB is used in combination with helium and neon, which emit scintillation photons with wavelengths shorter than 127 nm.},

abstract = {We evaluate the sensitivity of large, gadolinium-doped water detectors to antineutrinos released by nuclear fission explosions, using updated signal and background models and taking advantage of the capacity for seismic observations to provide an analysis trigger. Under certain realistic conditions, the antineutrino signature of a 250-kiloton pure fission explosion could be identified several hundred kilometers away in a detector about the size of the largest module currently proposed for a basic physics experiment. In principle, such an observation could provide rapid confirmation that the seismic signal coincided with a fission event, possibly useful for international monitoring of nuclear weapon tests. We discuss the limited potential for seismically-cued antineutrino observations to constrain fission yield, differentiate pure fission from fusion-enhanced weapon tests, indicate that the seismic evidence of an explosion had been intentionally masked, or verify the absence of explosive testing in a targeted area. We conclude that advances in seismic monitoring and neutrino physics have made the detection of explosion-derived antineutrinos more conceivable than previously asserted, but the size and cost of sufficiently sensitive detectors continue to limit applications.},

abstract = {A study of the dynamics of the positive charges in liquid argon has been carried out in the context of the future massive time projection chambers proposed for dark matter and neutrino physics. The ions spend considerably longer times in the active volume with respect to the electrons given their small mobility coefficient in liquid. The space charge can be additionally increased by the injection in the target volume of the ions produced by electron multiplying devices located in a gas phase above the liquid. The impact of the positive current on the uniformity of the field has been evaluated as well as the probability of the charge signal quenching due to the electron-ion recombination along the drift. The results show a potential concern for the operation of massive detectors with drift of many meters when located on surface.},

abstract = {Amorphous Si layers were grown by krypton plasmasputter deposition at 310 {\textdegree}C. By pulsation of the substrate potential between 0 and 50 eV, the Kr concentration in the layers could be varied to a maximum of 5.5 at. %. A model which describes trapping of inert gas atoms in the sputtered layer in terms of implantation and trapping,diffusion, growth, resputtering, and gas sputtering is presented. High-resolution electron microscopy, electrode-probe (x-ray) microanalysis, positron annihilation, Raman spectroscopy, M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy, and bending and hardness measurements were performed on the deposited layers. It turns out that the ion assisted growth leads to a strong reduction of open volume defects. The experiments point to the presence of very small Kr agglomerates. From the M{\"o}ssbauer experiments a lower limit of 250 K for the Debye temperature of the Kr agglomerates is derived. Molecular-dynamic simulations from which the Debye temperatures of Kr mono-, di-, and trimers in amorphous Si can be derived are presented. The simulations indicate the presence of predominantly Kr monomers and dimers.},

abstract = {This report summarizes the work of the Energy Frontier Higgs Boson working group of the 2013 Community Summer Study (Snowmass). We identify the key elements of a precision Higgs physics program and document the physics potential of future experimental facilities as elucidated during the Snowmass study. We study Higgs couplings to gauge boson and fermion pairs, double Higgs production for the Higgs self-coupling, its quantum numbers and CP-mixing in Higgs couplings, the Higgs mass and total width, and prospects for direct searches for additional Higgs bosons in extensions of the Standard Model. Our report includes projections of measurement capabilities from detailed studies of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), a Gamma-Gamma Collider, the International Linear Collider (ILC), the Large Hadron Collider High-Luminosity Upgrade (HL-LHC), Very Large Hadron Colliders up to 100 TeV (VLHC), a Muon Collider, and a Triple-Large Electron Positron Collider (TLEP).},

This has paved the way for the introduction of several novel radiotracers, each with their own inherent strengths and limitations. We present the insights gained from the use of these radiotracers at our institution.},

abstract = {Direct-detection experiments sensitive to low-energy electron recoils from sub-GeV dark matter interactions will also be sensitive to solar neutrinos via coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CNS), since the recoiling nucleus can produce a small ionization signal. Solar neutrinos constitute both an interesting signal in their own right and a potential background to a dark matter search that cannot be controlled or reduced by improved shielding, material purification and handling, or improved detector design. We explore these two possibilities in detail for semiconductor (silicon and germanium) and xenon targets, considering several possibilities for the unmeasured ionization efficiency at low energies. For dark-matter-electron-scattering searches, neutrinos start being an important background for exposures larger than $\ensuremath{\sim}1--10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{kg}\text{\ensuremath{-}}\mathrm{years}$ in silicon and germanium, and for exposures larger than $\ensuremath{\sim}0.1--1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{kg}\text{\ensuremath{-}}\mathrm{year}$ in xenon. For the absorption of bosonic dark matter (dark photons and axion-like particles) by electrons, neutrinos are most relevant for masses below $\ensuremath{\sim}1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{keV}$ and again slightly more important in xenon. Treating the neutrinos as a signal, we find that the CNS of $^{8}\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos can be observed with $\ensuremath{\sim}2\ensuremath{\sigma}$ significance with exposures of $\ensuremath{\sim}2$, 7, and 20 kg-years in xenon, germanium, and silicon, respectively, assuming there are no other backgrounds. We give an example for how this would constrain nonstandard neutrino interactions. Neutrino components at lower energy can only be detected if the ionization efficiency is sufficiently large. In this case, observing pep neutrinos via CNS requires exposures $\ensuremath{\gtrsim}10--100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{kg}\text{\ensuremath{-}}\mathrm{years}$ in silicon or germanium ($\ensuremath{\sim}1000\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{kg}$-years in xenon), and observing CNO neutrinos would require an order of magnitude more exposure. Only silicon could potentially detect $^{7}\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos. These measurements would allow for a direct measurement of the electron-neutrino survival probability over a wide energy range.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent data from CoGeNT and the DAMA annual modulation signal, we discuss collider constraints on the minimal supersymmetric standard model neutralino dark matter with mass in the 5\char21{}15 GeV range. The lightest superpartner (LSP) would be a bino with a small Higgsino admixture. Maximization of the dark matter nucleon scattering cross section for such a weakly interacting massive particle requires a light Higgs boson with $\mathrm{tan}﻿\ensuremath{\beta}$ enhanced couplings. Limits on the invisible width of the $Z$ boson, combined with the rare decays ${B}^{\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}\ensuremath{\tau}\ensuremath{\nu}$, and the ratio $B\ensuremath{\rightarrow}D\ensuremath{\tau}\ensuremath{\nu}/B\ensuremath{\rightarrow}D\ensuremath{\ell}\ensuremath{\nu}$, constrain cross sections to be below ${\ensuremath{\sigma}}_{n}\ensuremath{\lesssim}5\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}42}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$. This indicates a higher local dark matter density than is usually assumed by a factor of roughly 6 necessary to explain the CoGeNT excess. This scenario also requires a light charged Higgs boson, which can give substantial contributions to rare decays such as $b\ensuremath{\rightarrow}s\ensuremath{\gamma}$ and $t\ensuremath{\rightarrow}b{H}^{+}$. We also discuss the impact of Tevatron searches for Higgs bosons at large $\mathrm{tan}﻿\ensuremath{\beta}$.},

Simulations predict a relatively tight correlation between the local Ly$\alpha$ optical depth and the local gas or dark matter density. Statistical properties of the transmitted flux can constrain the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum at high redshift, test the assumption of Gaussian initial conditions, and probe the evolution of dark energy by measuring the Hubble parameter H(z). Simulations predict increased Ly$\alpha$ absorption in the vicinity of galaxies, but observations show a Ly$\alpha$ deficit within $\Delta$r ∼ 0.5h{\textminus}1 Mpc (comoving). We investigate idealized models of {\textquotedblleft}winds{\textquotedblright} and find that they must eliminate neutral hydrogen out to comoving radii ∼ 1.5h{\textminus}1 Mpc to marginally explain the data. Winds of this magnitude suppress the flux power spectrum by ∼ 0.1 dex but have little effect on the distribution function or threshold crossing frequency. In light of the strin...},

Experiments to observe this peak can give important information on the isospin structure of the neutral current. The experiments are very difficult, although the estimated cross sections (about ${10}^{\ensuremath{-}38}$ ${\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ on carbon) are favorable. The coherent cross sections (in contrast to incoherent) are almost energy-independent. Therefore, energies as low as 100 MeV may be suitable. Quasi-coherent nuclear excitation processes $\ensuremath{\nu}+A\ensuremath{\rightarrow}\ensuremath{\nu}+{A}^{*}$ provide possible tests of the conservation of the weak neutral current. Because of strong coherent effects at very low energies, the nuclear elastic scattering process may be important in inhibiting cooling by neutrino emission in stellar collapse and neutron stars.},

abstract = {Neutrinoless double beta decay is a process that violates lepton number conservation. It is predicted to occur in extensions of the standard model of particle physics. This Letter reports the results from phase I of the Germanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment at the Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy) searching for neutrinoless double beta decay of the isotope $^{76}\mathrm{Ge}$. Data considered in the present analysis have been collected between November 2011 and May 2013 with a total exposure of 21.6 kg yr. A blind analysis is performed. The background index is about $1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}2}\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{counts}/(\mathrm{keV}\text{ }\mathrm{kg}\text{ }\mathrm{yr})$ after pulse shape discrimination.

Few measurements have been made of this field dependence at recoil energies less than 10 keV. In this paper, we present results of such measurements using a specialized detector. Recoil energies are determined via the Compton coincidence technique at four drift fields relevant for liquid xenon dark matter detectors: 0.19, 0.48, 1.02, and $2.32\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{kV}/\mathrm{cm}$. Mean recoil energies down to 1 keV were measured with unprecedented precision. We find that the charge and light yield are anticorrelated above $\ensuremath{\sim}3\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{keV}$ and that the field dependence becomes negligible below $\ensuremath{\sim}6\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{keV}$. However, below 3 keV, we find a charge yield significantly higher than expectation and a reconstructed energy deviating from linearity.},

The search is performed in the context of the so-called coannihilation codex, a new paradigm that introduces novel scenarios for dark matter production. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and 2017, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $77.4{\textasciitilde}\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. In the examined scenario, a pair of scalar leptoquarks is assumed to be produced. One leptoquark decays to a muon and a jet while the other decays to dark matter and soft standard model particles. The dark matter signature is given by a peak at the leptoquark mass in the invariant mass distribution of the highest $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ muon and jet. The data are observed to agree with the predictions from the standard model. Leptoquarks with masses up to $1160{\textasciitilde}\mathrm{GeV}$ are excluded.},

Three tests were performed over a period of three to five weeks each in a vacuum of {\textasciitilde}5times10<sup>-6 </sup> torr with an average temperature of {\textasciitilde}25degC to simulate a space environment. Samples tested included FR4, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and alumina with copper electrodes attached to one or more of the sample surfaces. FR4 circuit-board material was found to have a dark-current resistivity of {\textasciitilde}1times10<sup>18</sup> Omegamiddotcm and a moderately high polarization current. Fiber-filled PTFE exhibited little polarization current and a dark-current resistivity of {\textasciitilde}3times10<sup>20</sup> Omegamiddotcm. Alumina had a measured dark-current resistivity of {\textasciitilde}3middot10<sup>17</sup> Omegamiddotcm, with a very large and more rapid polarization. Experimentally determined resistivity values were two to three orders of magnitude more than found using standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test methods. The 1-min wait time suggested for the standard ASTM tests is much shorter than the measured polarization current-decay times for each sample indicating that the primary currents used to determine ASTM resistivity are caused by the polarization of molecules in the applied electric field rather than charge transport through the bulk of the dielectric. Testing over much longer periods of time in vacuum is required to allow this polarization current to decay away and to allow the observation of charged-particle transport through a dielectric material. Application of a simple physics-based model allows separation of the polarization current and dark-current components from long-duration measurements of resistivity over day- to month-long time scales. Model parameters are directly related to the magnitude of charge transfer and storag- - e and the rate of charge transport},

abstract = {It has previously been proposed that annihilating dark matter particles with MeV-scale masses could be responsible for the flux of 511 keV photons observed from the region of the Galactic Bulge. The conventional wisdom, however, is that it is very challenging to construct a viable particle physics model containing MeV dark matter. In this paper, we challenge this conclusion by describing a simple and natural supersymmetric model in which the lightest supersymmetric particle naturally has a MeV-scale mass and the other phenomenological properties required to generate the 511 keV emission. In particular, the small ($\ensuremath{\sim}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}5}$) effective couplings between dark matter and the standard model fermions required in this scenario naturally lead to radiative corrections that generate MeV-scale masses for both the dark matter candidate and the mediator particle.},

abstract = {Silicon photosensors represent a viable alternative to standard photomultipliers in fields such as communications and medical imaging. We explored the interesting possibility of using these sensors in combination with liquid argon (LAr) for astroparticle physics applications such as neutrino, dark matter and double beta decay experiments. In fact, silicon photosensors have detection efficiencies comparable with those of the highest performance PMTs and can be manufactured with high level of radiopurity. In particular within the on-going R{\&}D activity of the SILENT project (Low background and low noise techniques for double beta decay physics funded by ASPERA) a large area SiPM (Silicon PhotoMultiplier - Hamamatsu S11828-3344M - 1.7 cm2 area) has been installed in a LAr scintillation chamber of 0.5 liters volume together with a cryogenic photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R11065) used as a reference. The liquid argon chamber has been exposed to many gamma sources of different energies and single photoelectron response and light yield for the SiPM and PMT have been measured and compared. In this contribution the results of the tests, and the ongoing R{\&}D to optimize the SiPM for cryogenic and for ultralow background applications, are reported, as well as the possible application in the GERDA experiment on Double Beta Decay Searches of 76Ge.},

An electron-gas model is applied to a treatment of the excitation of valence electrons, and an additional term is constructed which accounts for core-electron excitation. Nonparticipating electrons are excluded by application of an adiabaticity criterion. The channel-stopping powers that result are typically 20-25% of those characteristic of random incidence, indicating a relatively pronounced channeling effect for the alkali iodides. The calculated curves are combined with appropriate scintillation-efficiency data ($\frac{\mathrm{dL}}{\mathrm{dE}}$ versus $\frac{\mathrm{dE}}{\mathrm{dx}}$) corresponding to bombardment of NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl) scintillation counters, in order to obtain a prediction of the luminescent response ($L$ versus $E$) to the channeled particles, and thus to account quantitatively for a reported anisotropy in the scintillation spectra. Higher than normal scintillation efficiency is predicted for the channeled particles, indicating that the crystal channels in NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl) are axes preferential for luminescence. This effect may be explained qualitatively by reduced ionization density for channeled particles, which favors radiative recombination of electrons and holes at ${\mathrm{Tl}}^{+}$ sites over competing non-radiative recombination.},

abstract = {A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle. Introduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally high-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities. Argon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the purge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses through materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact with the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a modulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These impurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting a 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in DAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron flux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a seasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions 40Ca(n,$\alpha$)37Ar and 36Ar(n,$\gamma$)37Ar. Scenario 2): Radon is also in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the current DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the resulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be ionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting in characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from radon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to a small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar within the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test through assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of the DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation.},

abstract = {The time dependence of the luminescence due to the recombination process of electrons and ions in liquid argon, krypton, and xenon excited by $^{207}\mathrm{Bi}$ internal-conversion electrons has been studied by considering the difference curve of two decay curves, the one in the absence of electric field and the one with such a high electric field that all of the observed decay characteristics can be attributed to self-trapped exciton luminescence. The time dependence is well explained by using the kinetic equation for electrons and the recombination process, without diffusion. This provides good evidence for the existence of a strong Coulomb interaction of thermalized electrons and ions. Two excited molecular states $^{1}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$ and $^{3}\ensuremath{\Sigma}_{u}^{+}$ are formed through the recombination process, as in the case of self-trapped exciton luminescence. The recombination cross sections, in units of ${10}^{\ensuremath{-}16}$ ${\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$, are 7000\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}2000 for liquid argon, 120\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}30 for liquid krypton, and 10\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}2 for liquid xenon. The considerably small values for liquid krypton and xenon compared with that for liquid argon are explained by the unfavorable crossing of the ${{R}_{2}}^{+}$ and repulsive ${{R}_{2}}^{**}$ potential curves in the liquid, based on the theory of dissociative recombination ${{R}_{2}}^{+}+e\ensuremath{\rightleftarrows}{{R}_{2}}^{**}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{R}^{**}+R$ in the gaseous state.},

abstract = {There are many books that discuss distillation, but there is only one that concentrates on giving readers practical guidelines for operation, troubleshooting and control. This is that book. Its contents revolves around over 300 actual case histories of distillation problems that occurred in the past. Each problem and its solution are briefly described, and the lessons learned are molded into the practical guidelines that make up the book. Carefully focused, the book shows you how over 90% of all column malfunctions occurred in the past, how they were solved, and how to prevent them in the future. Starting with column internals and their malfunctions, it progresses to installation, commissioning, startup and normal operation before surveying the auxiliary system and the column automatic controls--how they should be, how they can go wrong, and how you can repair them. This book offers the best available compendium of Do's and Don'ts, good practices, and guidelines for trouble-free design, operation and troubleshooting for inlets and outlets; distributors; avoiding tray damage; installation; commissioning and startup techniques; column flood and efficiency testing; pressure, temperature and boilup control; and many more.},

Background contributions due to solar neutrino interactions with $\ensuremath{\beta}\ensuremath{\beta}$ nuclei of $^{82}\mathrm{Se}, ^{100}\mathrm{Mo}$, and $^{150}\mathrm{Nd}$ are evaluated. They are shown to be significant for future high-sensitivity $\ensuremath{\beta}\ensuremath{\beta}$ experiments that may search for Majorana neutrino masses in the inverted-hierarchy mass region. The impact of solar neutrino backgrounds and their reduction are discussed for future $\ensuremath{\beta}\ensuremath{\beta}$ experiments.},

abstract = {The goal of the present work has been to develop a method for the efficient and reliable production of gadolinium- and boron-containing solid scintillator. Polyvinyl toluene, silicone rubber, and other materials were investigated. Gadolinium in a solid overcomes the limitations of the physical form of a liquid, and silicone rubber as a carrier for either gadolinium or boron overcomes the thermal limitations of plastics. Silicone rubbers also introduce some interesting and useful properties (such as flexibility) of their own. We report here the fabrication of solid organic scintillators loaded with as much as 2% gadolinium, and more than 5% boron. A gadolinium-containing compound, soluble in vinyl toluene monomer and not inhibiting polymerization, was found. The same compound was also found to be soluble in phenyl-substituted silicone fluids that subsequently could be polymerized. In addition, a class of boron compounds also soluble in silicone fluids and not inhibiting polymerization was found. In the absence of phosphors, the resulting boron- and gadolinium-loaded disks were clear and colorless, or only slightly yellow. The disks were compatible with UV-, blue-, blue-green, and green-emitting phosphors and a variety of colors were realized. In addition, it was found in the case of gadolinium loading, the discrete spectrum due to atomic x-rays and conversion was observable if the scintillator sample was small.},

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of spirulina supplementation on (i) exercise performance, (ii) substrate metabolism, and (iii) blood redox status both at rest and after exercise.</p><b>Methods:</b><p>Nine moderately trained males took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced crossover study. Each subject received either spirulina (6 g{\textperiodcentered}d{\textminus}1) or placebo for 4 wk. Each subject ran on a treadmill at an intensity corresponding to 70%-75% of their V{\.{ }}O2max for 2 h and then at 95% V{\.{ }}O2max to exhaustion. Exercise performance and respiratory quotient during exercise were measured after both placebo and spirulina supplementation. Blood samples were drawn before, immediately after, and at 1, 24, and 48 h after exercise. Reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), GSH/GSSG, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls, catalase activity, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined.</p><b>Results:</b><p>Time to fatigue after the 2-h run was significantly longer after spirulina supplementation (2.05 {\textpm} 0.68 vs 2.70 {\textpm} 0.79 min). Ingestion of spirulina significantly decreased carbohydrate oxidation rate by 10.3% and increased fat oxidation rate by 10.9% during the 2-h run compared with the placebo trial. GSH levels were higher after the spirulina supplementation compared with placebo at rest and 24 h after exercise. TBARS levels increased after exercise after placebo but not after spirulina supplementation. Protein carbonyls, catalase, and TAC levels increased similarly immediately after and 1 h after exercise in both groups.</p><b>Conclusions:</b><p>Spirulina supplementation induced a significant increase in exercise performance, fat oxidation, and GSH concentration and attenuated the exercise-induced increase in lipid peroxidation.</p>},

abstract = {<b>BACKGROUND:</b><p>C-phycocyanin (C-PC), a biliprotein found in blue green algae, such as Spirulina platensis, is often used as a dietary nutritional supplement due to its various therapeutic values. In addition, the antiinflammatory activity of C-PC partly through inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine formation, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygeanase-2 (COX-2) expression has been demonstrated in many in vitro and in vivo studies. However, whether C-PC also has antihyperalgesic activity in inflammatory nociception has not been investigated.</p><b>METHODS:</b><p>Using a carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia model, we evaluated the effect of C-PC on nociception by measuring paw withdrawal latency. To clarify the mechanisms involved, the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and the formation of nitrate and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) in the rat paw were determined.</p><b>RESULTS:</b><p>Pre- or posttreatment with C-PC (30 or 50 mg/kg, IP) significantly attenuated carrageenan-induced inflammatory nociception and the induction of iNOS and COX-2 at the late phase, (4 h) accompanied by an inhibition of the formation of TNF-$\alpha$, prostaglandin E2, nitrate and myeloperoxidase activity.</p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>Based on these results, it is suggested that the inhibition of NO and prostaglandin E2 over-production through suppressing iNOS and COX-2 induction and attenuation of TNF-$\alpha$ formation and neutrophil infiltration into inflammatory sites by C-PC may contribute, at least in part, to its antihyperalgesic activity.</p>},

abstract = {Evidence for the role of molecular structure on the difference in the thermodynamic properties of isotopic molecules in the liquid and solid states is summarized. The properties considered are vapor pressure, heats of vaporization, molal volume, and transition temperatures. It is shown that the molecular structure must be taken into consideration even for small quantum effects. In the approximation of the first quantum correction the difference in thermodynamic properties of isotopic molecules in the condensed state depends upon the atomic masses and an energy parameter associated with each atom in the molecule. The results are extended to higher-order quantum corrections for a harmonic potential. The rules of the mean are obtained directly. Various frequency distributions for the lattice modes are considered. For the case where the internal frequencies in the condensed phase are similar to the free molecule, the ordered quantum corrections can be used for T{\&}gt;(hv max/12(2){\textonehalf} k)mol; T{\&}gt;(hv lattice/2$\pi$k). The role of the gas imperfection and the molal volume of the condensed phase is discussed for equilibria between gaseous and condensed phases. It is shown that the difference in molal volumes of isotopic molecules is a second-order effect. The difference in molal volumes of isotopic molecules is evaluated by an extension of Gruneisen{\&}apos;s equation of state to molecular lattices. The results are in good agreement with available experimental data.},

abstract = {Precise predictions of the antineutrino spectra emitted by nuclear reactors is a key ingredient in measurements of reactor neutrino oscillations as well as in recent applications to the surveillance of power plants in the context of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. We report new calculations including the latest information from nuclear databases and a detailed error budget. The first part of this work is the so-called ab initio approach where the total antineutrino spectrum is built from the sum of all $\ensuremath{\beta}$ branches of all fission products predicted by an evolution code. Systematic effects and missing information in nuclear databases lead to final relative uncertainties in the $10\char21{}20%$ range. A prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the fission of $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ is given based on this ab initio method. For the dominant isotopes we developed a more accurate approach combining information from nuclear databases and reference electron spectra associated with the fission of $^{235}\mathrm{U}$, $^{239}\mathrm{Pu}$, and $^{241}\mathrm{Pu}$, measured at Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1980s. We show how the anchor point of the measured total $\ensuremath{\beta}$ spectra can be used to suppress the uncertainty in nuclear databases while taking advantage of all the information they contain. We provide new reference antineutrino spectra for $^{235}\mathrm{U}$, $^{239}\mathrm{Pu}$, and $^{241}\mathrm{Pu}$ isotopes in the 2\char21{}8 MeV range. While the shapes of the spectra and their uncertainties are comparable to those of the previous analysis of the ILL data, the normalization is shifted by about $+3%$ on average. In the perspective of the reanalysis of past experiments and direct use of these results by upcoming oscillation experiments, we discuss the various sources of errors and their correlations as well as the corrections induced by off-equilibrium effects.},

The standard model also includes quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong nuclear interactions.  The final capstone of the model was the Higgs particle discovered in 2012 at CERN.  But the model is very far from being the last word; there are still many gaps in our understanding.},

These reactions form a cycle in which the original nucleus is reproduced, viz. ${\mathrm{C}}^{12}$+H=${\mathrm{N}}^{13}$, ${\mathrm{N}}^{13}={\mathrm{C}}^{13}+{\ensuremath{\epsilon}}^{+}$, ${\mathrm{C}}^{13}$+H=${\mathrm{N}}^{14}$, ${\mathrm{N}}^{14}$+H=${\mathrm{O}}^{15}$, ${\mathrm{O}}^{15}={\mathrm{N}}^{15}+{\ensuremath{\epsilon}}^{+}$, ${\mathrm{N}}^{15}$+H=${\mathrm{C}}^{12}$ +${\mathrm{He}}^{4}$. Thus carbon and nitrogen merely serve as catalysts for the combination of four protons (and two electrons) into an $\ensuremath{\alpha}$-particle (\textsection{}7).},

abstract = {High-pressure adsorption of helium, neon, argon, nitrogen, krypton, and methane on zeolites 3A, 4A, 5A, and 13X was measured at room temperature up to 500 MPa. The corresponding isotherms are qualitatively comparable to those previously obtained with the same gases adsorbed on activated carbon. They are analyzed and compared to those calculated on the basis of the Ruthven thermodynamic model of adsorption on zeolites. The respective importance of the contributions of solid{\textminus}gas and gas{\textminus}gas interactions and the exact role of pores were established. Attractive forces involve the isotherm maximum whereas repulsive forces are predominant at high pressure and involve a slight reincrease of adsorption. As concerns the well-calibrated pores of zeolites, in addition to their molecular sieving effect, they contribute mainly to increasing the specific area.},

abstract = {Borexino is an experiment for low-energy neutrino spectroscopy at the Gran Sasso underground laboratories. It is designed to measure the monoenergetic $^{7}\mathrm{Be}$ solar neutrino flux in real time, via neutrino-electron elastic scattering in an ultrapure organic liquid scintillator. Borexino has the potential to also detect neutrinos from the $\mathit{pep}$ fusion process and the CNO cycle. For this measurement to be possible, radioactive contamination in the detector must be kept extremely low. Once sufficiently clean conditions are met, the main background source is $^{11}\mathrm{C}$, produced in reactions induced by the residual cosmic muon flux on $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. In the process, a free neutron is almost always produced. $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ can be tagged on an event-by-event basis by looking at the threefold coincidence with the parent muon track and the subsequent neutron capture on protons. This coincidence method has been implemented on the Borexino Counting Test Facility data. We report on the first event-by-event identification of in situ muon-induced $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ in a large underground scintillator detector. We measure a $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ production rate of 0.130 \ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{} 0.026(stat) \ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{} 0.014(syst) day${}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ ton${}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$, in agreement with predictions from both experimental studies performed with a muon beam on a scintillator target and ab initio estimations based on the $^{11}\mathrm{C}$ producing nuclear reactions.},

abstract = {This Report summarizes the results of the activities in 2012 and the first half of 2013 of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group. The main goal of the working group was to present the state of the art of Higgs Physics at the LHC, integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. This report follows the first working group report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002) and the second working group report Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross Sections: 2. Differential Distributions (CERN-2012-002). After the discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC in mid-2012 this report focuses on refined prediction of Standard Model (SM) Higgs phenomenology around the experimentally observed value of 125-126 GeV, refined predictions for heavy SM-like Higgs bosons as well as predictions in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and first steps to go beyond these models. The other main focus is on the extraction of the characteristics and properties of the newly discovered particle such as couplings to SM particles, spin and CP-quantum numbers etc.},

abstract = {A study was carried out to investigate the use of annihilation coincidence detection (ACD) in emmision transaxial reconstruction tomography. The ACD was evaluated in terms of spatial resolution and sensitivity with depth, detection efficiency, effect of pulse-height analysis on resolution and efficiency, correction for attenuation, and cold spot contrast. A prototype positron emission transaxial tomograph (PETT) consisting of a hexagonal array of 24 Nal (Tl) detectors employing ACD was constructed. A fast Fourier transform algorithm was employed to generate the reconstructed image. Computer simulations and phantom and animal studies were carried out to demonstrate that this approach yields tomographic radionuclide images that have high resolution and contrast (hot and cold spot) and that are independent of activity above and below the plane examined. The ACD yields a quantitative nuclear medicine imaging device with high detection efficiency. Comparisons are presented between the ACD and the scintillation camera and scanner. Discussion of the possible applications of the PETT in nuclear medicine is included.},

abstract = {DarkSide-50 is a direct detection experiment searching for WIMP dark matter operated at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, consisting of a dual-phase argon time projection chamber nested within an active neutron veto. The core detector is filled with a target of argon extracted from underground sources that is depleted in radioactive Argon-39.
	This thesis details the blind analysis of 532.4 live-days of data acquired between Aug 2015 and Oct 2017. Particular attention will be paid to the analysis of the electron recoil background, which includes: estimating the rates of radioisotope decay that are responsible; modeling the scintillation response of electron recoil events in liquid argon; and developing a cut utilizing pulse-shape discrimination to control the electron recoil background.
	We observe a background- and signal-free result, and report a 90% C.L. upper limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section of 1.1E-44 cm^2 (3.8E-44 cm^2, 3.4E-43 cm^2) for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c^2 (1 TeV/c^2, 10 TeV/c^2).},

abstract = {The Pauli exclusion principle (PEP) has been tested for nucleons ($n,p$) in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ with the Borexino detector. The approach consists of a search for $\ensuremath{\gamma}$, $n$, $p$, and ${\ensuremath{\beta}}^{\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}}$ emitted in a non-Paulian transition of $1{P}_{3/2}$-shell nucleons to the filled $1{S}_{1/2}$ shell in nuclei. Due to the extremely low background and the large mass ($278$ tons) of the Borexino detector, the following most stringent up-to-date experimental bounds on PEP violating transitions of nucleons have been established: $\ensuremath{\tau}({}^{12}\mathrm{C}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{}^{12}\stackrel{{\textasciitilde}}{\mathrm{C}}+\ensuremath{\gamma})\ensuremath{\geqslant}5.0\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{31}$ yr, $\ensuremath{\tau}({}^{12}\mathrm{C}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{}^{11}\stackrel{{\textasciitilde}}{\mathrm{B}}+p)\ensuremath{\geqslant}8.9\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{29}$ yr, $\ensuremath{\tau}({}^{12}\mathrm{C}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{}^{11}\stackrel{{\textasciitilde}}{\mathrm{C}}+n)\ensuremath{\geqslant}3.4\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{30}$ yr, $\ensuremath{\tau}({}^{12}\mathrm{C}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{}^{12}\stackrel{{\textasciitilde}}{\mathrm{N}}+{e}^{\ensuremath{-}}+\stackrel{{\textasciitilde}}{{\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e}})\ensuremath{\geqslant}3.1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{30}$ yr, and $\ensuremath{\tau}({}^{12}\mathrm{C}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}{}^{12}\stackrel{{\textasciitilde}}{\mathrm{B}}+{e}^{+}+{\ensuremath{\nu}}_{e})\ensuremath{\geqslant}2.1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{30}$ yr, all at $90%$ C.L. The corresponding upper limits on the relative strengths for the searched non-Paulian electromagnetic, strong and weak transitions have been estimated as ${\ensuremath{\delta}}_{\ensuremath{\gamma}}^{2}\ensuremath{\leqslant}2.2\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}57}$, ${\ensuremath{\delta}}_{N}^{2}\ensuremath{\leqslant}4.1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}60}$, and ${\ensuremath{\delta}}_{\ensuremath{\beta}}^{2}\ensuremath{\leqslant}2.1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}35}$.},

abstract = {Electron emission from liquid into gaseous xenon is a cornerstone of dark matter search detectors such as ZEPLIN, XENON, LUX and LZ. The probability of emission is a function of the applied electric field E, and electrons which fail to pass from the liquid into the gas have been previously hypothesized to become thermalized and trapped. This article shows, for the first time, quantitative agreement between an electron emission model and existing data. The model predicts that electrons in the liquid must surmount a typical potential barrier phi_b=0.34+-0.01 eV in order to escape into the gas. This value is a factor of about x2 smaller than has previously been calculated or inferred. Knowledge of phi_b allows calculation of the lifetime of thermalized, trapped electrons. The value is O(10) ms, which appears to be compatible with XENON10 observations of electron train backgrounds. As these backgrounds limit the sensitivity of dark sector dark matter searches, possible mitigations are discussed.},

abstract = {Background and Objective. Oxidative stress is intimately associated with many diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Study objectives include a comparison of the oxidative stress, antioxidant status, and lipid profile between COPD patients and controls and evaluation of the effect of spirulina intervention on oxidative stress, antioxidant status, and lipid profile of COPD patients. Methods. 30 patients with COPD and 20 controls with no respiratory problems were selected. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria were served as the basis of COPD diagnosis. The serum content of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid hydroperoxide, glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was measured. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) was also measured. Two different doses, (500 {\&}{\#}xd7; 2){\&}{\#}x2009;mg and (500 {\&}{\#}xd7; 4){\&}{\#}x2009;mg spirulina, were given to two groups, each of which comprises 15 COPD patients. Results. All targeted blood parameters have significant difference between COPD patients and controls except triglyceride (TG). Spirulina intake for 30 and 60 days at (500 {\&}{\#}xd7; 2){\&}{\#}x2009;mg dose has significantly reduced serum content of MDA, lipid hydroperoxide, and cholesterol while increasing GSH, Vit C level , and the activity of SOD and GST . At the same time, spirulina intake for 30 and 60 days at (500 {\&}{\#}xd7; 4){\&}{\#}x2009;mg dose has favorable significant effect on all targeted blood parameters except for HDL .},

abstract = {Liquid xenon (Xe) is one of the commendable detecting media for the dark matter detections. However, the small content of radioactive krypton-85 (85Kr) always exists in the commercial xenon products. An efficient cryogenic distillation system to remove this krypton (Kr) from commercial xenon products has been specifically designed, developed, and constructed in order to meet the requirements of the dark matter experiments with high- sensitivity and low-background. The content of krypton in regular commercial xenon products can be reduced from 10{\textminus}9 to 10{\textminus}12, with 99% xenon collection efficiency at maximum flow rate of 5 kg/h (15SLPM). The purified xenon gases produced by this distillation system can be used as the detecting media in the project of Panda X, which is the first dark matter detector developed in China.},

abstract = {We report a search for Higgs bosons that are produced via vector boson fusion and subsequently decay into invisible particles. The experimental signature is two energetic jets with O(1)  TeV invariant mass and O(100)  GeV missing transverse momentum. The analysis uses 36.1 fb-1 of pp collision data at 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. In the signal region the 2252 observed events are consistent with the background estimation. Assuming a 125 GeV particle with Standard Model cross sections, the upper limit on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay into invisible particles is 0.37 at 95% CL where 0.28 was expected. This limit is interpreted in Higgs portal models to set limits on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section. We also consider invisible decays of additional scalar bosons with masses up to 3 TeV for which the upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are in the range of 0.3-2.0 pb.},

abstract = {We use the distribution of accreted stars in SDSS-Gaia DR2 to demonstrate that the local dark matter halo may not be in equilibrium and that a non-trivial fraction is in substructure. Using a mixture likelihood analysis, we separate the contributions of an old, isotropic stellar halo and a younger anisotropic population. The latter dominates and is uniform within Galactocentric radii of 7.5-10 kpc and |z| > 2.5 kpc. It can be explained as the tidal debris of a disrupted massive satellite on a highly radial orbit, and is consistent with mounting evidence from recent studies. Simulations that track the tidal debris from such mergers find that the dark matter traces the kinematics of its stellar counterpart. If so, our results indicate that the majority of the local dark matter that is sourced by luminous satellites is in kinematic substructure referred to as debris flow. These results challenge the Standard Halo Model, which is highly discrepant with the distribution recovered from the stellar data, and have important ramifications for the interpretation of direct detection experiments.},

These models emerge naturally from gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, where they elegantly solve the dark-matter problem. The framework accommodates single or multiple component dark matter, dark-matter masses from 10 MeV to 10 TeV, and interaction strengths from gravitational to strong. These candidates enhance many direct and indirect signals relative to weakly interacting massive particles and have qualitatively new implications for dark-matter searches and cosmological implications for colliders.},

abstract = {We present new weak-lensing observations of 1E 0657-558 (z = 0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 $\sigma$ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

abstract = {Guidelines for management of peptic ulcer patients after the treatment are largely directed to detection of H. pylori infection using only non-invasive tests. We compared the diagnostic value of non-invasive and endoscopy based H. pylori tests in a late post-treatment setting. Altogether 34 patients with dyspeptic complaints were referred for gastroscopy 5 years after the treatment of peptic ulcer using a one-week triple therapy scheme. The endoscopic and histologic findings were evaluated according to the Sydney classification. Bacteriological, PCR and cytological investigations and 13 C-UBT tests were performed. Seventeen patients were defined H. pylori positive by 13 C-UBT test, PCR and histological examination. On endoscopy, peptic ulcer persisted in 4 H. pylori positive cases. Among the 6 cases with erosions of the gastric mucosa, only two patients were H. pylori positive. Mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were revealed both in the H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative cases. Bacteriological examination revealed three clarithromycin resistant H. pylori strains. Cytology failed to prove validity for diagnosing H. pylori in a post-treatment setting. In a late post-treatment setting, patients with dyspepsia should not be monitored only by non-invasive investigation methods; it is also justified to use the classical histological evaluation of H. pylori colonisation, PCR and bacteriology as they have shown good concordance with 13 C-UBT. Moreover, endoscopy and histological investigation of a gastric biopsy have proved to be the methods with an additional diagnostic value, providing the physician with information about inflammatory, atrophic and metaplastic lesions of the stomach in dyspeptic H. pylori positive and negative patients. Bacteriological methods are suggested for detecting the putative antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori, aimed at successful eradication of infection in persistent peptic ulcer cases.},

abstract = {Time-of-flight (TOF) PET was initially introduced in the early days of PET. The TOF PET scanners developed in the 1980s had limited sensitivity and spatial resolution, were operated in 2-dimensional mode with septa, and used analytic image reconstruction methods. The current generation of TOF PET scanners has the highest sensitivity and spatial resolution ever achieved in commercial whole-body PET, is operated in fully-3-dimensional mode, and uses iterative reconstruction with full system modeling. Previously, it was shown that TOF provides a gain in image signal-to-noise ratio that is proportional to the square root of the object size divided by the system timing resolution. With oncologic studies being the primary application of PET, more recent work has shown that in modern TOF PET scanners there is an improved tradeoff between lesion contrast, image noise, and total imaging time, leading to a combination of improved lesion detectability, reduced scan time or injected dose, and more accurate and precise lesion uptake measurement. Because the benefit of TOF PET is also higher for heavier patients, clinical performance is more uniform over all patient sizes.},

abstract = {In a recent paper Birge and Menzel pointed out that if hydrogen had an isotope with mass number two present to the extent of one part in 4500, it would explain the discrepancy which exists between the atomic weights of hydrogen as determined chemically and with the mass spectrograph, when reduced to the same standard. Systematic arrangements of atomic nuclei require the existence of isotopes of hydrogen ${\mathrm{H}}^{2}$ and ${\mathrm{H}}^{3}$ and helium ${\mathrm{He}}^{5}$ to give them a completed appearance when they are extra-polated to the limit of nuclei with small proton and electron numbers. An isotope of hydrogen with mass number two has been found present to the extent of one part in about 4000 in ordinary hydrogen; no evidence for ${\mathrm{H}}^{3}$ was obtained. The vapor pressures of pure crystals containing only a single species of the isotopic molecules ${\mathrm{H}}^{1}$${\mathrm{H}}^{1}$, ${\mathrm{H}}^{1}$${\mathrm{H}}^{2}$, ${\mathrm{H}}^{1}$${\mathrm{H}}^{3}$ were calculated after postulating: (1) that the rotational and vibrational energies of the molecules are the same in the solid and gaseous states; (2) that in the Debye theory of the solid state, the $\ensuremath{\Theta}'\mathrm{s}$ are inversely proportional to the square roots of the molecular masses; (3) that the free energy of the gas is given by the free energy equation of an ideal monatomic gas; and (4) that there is a zero point lattice energy equal to $(\frac{9}{8})R\ensuremath{\Theta}$ per mole. The calculated vapor pressures of the three isotopic molecules in equilibrium with their solids at the triple point for ordinary hydrogen are in the ratio ${p}_{11}:{p}_{12}:{p}_{13}=1:0.37:0.29$. The isotope was concentrated in three samples of gas by evaporating large quantities of liquid hydrogen and collecting the gas which evaporated from the last two or three cc. Sample I was collected from the end portion of six liters evaporated at atmospheric pressure and samples II and III from four liters, each, evaporated at a pressure only a few millimeters above the triple point.},

abstract = {ArDM-1t is the first operating ton-scale liquid argon detector for direct search of Dark Matter particles. Developed at CERN as Recognized Experiment RE18, the experiment has been approved in 2010 to be installed in the Spanish underground site LSC (Laboratorio Subterraneo de Canfranc). Under the label of LSC EXP-08-2010 the ArDM detector underwent an intensive period of technical completion and safety approval until the recent filling of the target vessel with almost 2 ton of liquid argon. This report describes the experimental achievements during commissioning of ArDM and the transition into a stage of first physics data taking in single phase operational mode. We present preliminary observations from this run. A first indication for the background discrimination power of LAr detectors at the ton-scale is shown. We present an outlook for completing the detector with the electric drift field and upgrade of the scintillation light readout system with novel detector modules based on SiPMs in order to improve the light yield.},

abstract = {We suggest a novel experimental concept for detecting MeV-to-GeV-mass dark matter, in which the dark matter scatters off electrons in a scintillating target and produces a signal of one or a few photons. New large-area photodetectors are needed to measure the photon signal with negligible dark counts, which could be constructed from transition edge sensor (TES) or microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) technology. Alternatively, detecting two photons in coincidence may allow the use of conventional photodetectors like photomultiplier tubes. We describe why scintillators may have distinct advantages over other experiments searching for a low ionization signal from sub-GeV dark matter, as there are fewer potential sources of spurious backgrounds. We discuss various target choices, but focus on calculating the expected dark matter-electron scattering rates in three scintillating crystals: sodium iodide (NaI), cesium iodide (CsI), and gallium arsenide (GaAs). Among these, GaAs has the lowest band gap (1.52 eV) compared to NaI (5.9 eV) or CsI (6.4 eV), which in principle allows it to probe dark matter masses as low as $\ensuremath{\sim}0.5\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{MeV}$, compared to $\ensuremath{\sim}1.5\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{MeV}$ with NaI or CsI. We compare these scattering rates with those expected in silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The proposed experimental concept presents an important complementary path to existing efforts, and its potential advantages may make it the most sensitive direct-detection probe of dark matter down to MeV masses.},

abstract = {We present new constraints on the dark matter-induced annual modulation signal using 1.7\,years, of COSINE-100 data with a total exposure of 97.7\,kgyears. The COSINE-100 experiment, consisting of 106\,kg of NaI(Tl) target, is designed to carry out a model-independent test of DAMA/LIBRA's claim by searching for the same annual modulation signal using the same NaI(Tl) target. The crystal data show 2.7 counts/keV/kg/day background rate on average in the 2--6 keV energy region of interest. Using a chi-squared minimization method we observe best fit values for modulation amplitude and phase at 0.00920.0067 counts/keV/kg/day and 127.245.9 days, respectively.},

Relative to previous searches by EXO-200, the energy resolution of the detector has been improved to $\sigma$/E=1.23%, the electric field in the drift region has been raised by 50%, and a system to suppress radon in the volume between the cryostat and lead shielding has been implemented. In addition, analysis techniques that improve topological discrimination between 0$\beta$\!$\beta$ and background events have been developed. Incorporating these hardware and analysis improvements, the median 90% confidence level 0$\beta$\!$\beta$ half-life sensitivity after combining with the full data set acquired before the upgrade has increased 2-fold to 3.7  1025 yr. No statistically significant evidence for 0$\beta$\!$\beta$ is observed, leading to a lower limit on the 0$\beta$\!$\beta$ half-life of 1.81025 yr at the 90% confidence level.},

The exposure used for these results is $24\text{ }524.3\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{kg}\ifmmode\cdot\else\textperiodcentered\fi{}\mathrm{days}$. Nuclei recoiling from WIMP interactions are identified by a pulse shape discrimination method. A low energy background due to alpha emitters on the crystal surfaces is identified and taken into account in the analysis. The detected numbers of nuclear recoils are consistent with zero and 90% confidence level upper limits on the WIMP interaction rates are set for electron equivalent energies from 3 to 11 keV. The 90% upper limit of the nuclear recoil event rate for 3.6\char21{}5.8 keV corresponding to 2\char21{}4 keV in $\mathrm{NaI}(\mathrm{T}\ensuremath{\ell})$ is 0.0098 counts/kg/keV/day, which is below the annual modulation amplitude reported by DAMA. This is incompatible with interpretations that enhance the modulation amplitude such as inelastic dark matter models. We establish the most stringent cross section limits on spin-dependent WIMP-proton elastic scattering for the WIMP masses greater than $20\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$.},

A seasonal modulation with a period of (366.3  0.6)\,d and a relative amplitude of (1.36 0.04)% is observed. The phase is measured to be (181.7  0.4)\,d, corresponding to a maximum at the 1st of July. Using data inferred from global atmospheric models, we show the muon flux to be positively correlated with the atmospheric temperature and measure the effective temperature coefficient $\alpha$T = 0.90  0.02. The origin of cosmic muons from pion and kaon decays in the atmosphere allows to interpret the effective temperature coefficient as an indirect measurement of the atmospheric kaon-to-pion production ratio r$\mathrm{K}$/$\pi$ = 0.11+0.11-0.07 for primary energies above 18\,TeV. We find evidence for a long-term modulation of the muon flux with a period of  3000\,d and a maximum in June 2012 that is not present in the atmospheric temperature data. A possible correlation between this modulation and the solar activity is investigated. The cosmogenic neutron production rate is found to show a seasonal modulation in phase with the cosmic muon flux but with an increased amplitude of (2.6  0.4)%.},

Since the start of operations in 2007, Borexino has produced measurements of 7Be, 8B, and pep solar neutrinos, as well as measurements of terrestrial and long-baseline reactor antineutrinos. The measurements were made possible by the development of low-background scintillator spectroscopy that enabled direct detection of sub-MeV solar neutrinos.

abstract = {We consider the hypothesis that dark matter (DM) has tree-level interactions only with leptons. Such a framework, where DM recoils against electrons bound in atoms, has been proposed as an explanation for the annually modulated scintillation signal in DAMA/LIBRA data versus the absence of a signal for nuclear recoils in experiments like CDMS or XENON10. However, even in such a leptophilic DM scenario there are loop-induced DM-hadron interactions, where photons emitted from virtual leptons couple to the charge of a nucleus. Using a general effective field theory approach we show that, if such an interaction is induced at one- or two-loop level, then DM-nucleus scattering dominates over DM-electron scattering. This is because the latter is suppressed by the bound state wave function. One obtains a situation similar to standard DM-nucleus scattering analyses with considerable tension between the results of DAMA and CDMS/XENON10. This conclusion does not apply in the case of pseudoscalar or axial-vector coupling between DM and leptons, where the loop diagrams vanish. In this case the explanation of the DAMA signal in terms of DM-electron scattering is strongly disfavored by the spectral shape of the signal. Furthermore, if DM can annihilate into neutrinos or tau leptons, the required cross sections are excluded by many orders of magnitude using the Super-Kamiokande bound on neutrinos from DM annihilations in the Sun.},

This paper develops a mathematical model for the (13C) isotope cryogenic distillation process using two subsystems of the plant: the hydrodynamic part and the isotope-separation part. The model is validated using experimental data from the pilot column from the National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies Cluj-Napoca. The proposed model is suitable for various cryogenic distillation columns, using the proper parameters.},

abstract = {Borexino, a liquid scintillator detector at LNGS, is designed for the detection of neutrinos and antineutrinos from the Sun, supernovae, nuclear reactors, and the Earth. The feeble nature of these signals requires a strong suppression of backgrounds below a few MeV. Very low intrinsic radiogenic contamination of all detector components needs to be accompanied by the efficient identification of muons and of muon-induced backgrounds. Muons produce unstable nuclei by spallation processes along their trajectory through the detector whose decays can mimic the expected signals; for isotopes with half-lives longer than a few seconds, the dead time induced by a muon-related veto becomes unacceptably long, unless its application can be restricted to a sub-volume along the muon track. Consequently, not only the identification of muons with very high efficiency but also a precise reconstruction of their tracks is of primary importance for the physics program of the experiment. The Borexino inner detector is surrounded by an outer water-Cherenkov detector that plays a fundamental role in accomplishing this task. The detector design principles and their implementation are described. The strategies adopted to identify muons are reviewed and their efficiency is evaluated. The overall muon veto efficiency is found to be 99.992 % or better. Ad-hoc track reconstruction algorithms developed are presented. Their performance is tested against muon events of known direction such as those from the CNGS neutrino beam, test tracks available from a dedicated External Muon Tracker and cosmic muons whose angular distribution reflects the local overburden profile. The achieved angular resolution is {\textasciitilde} 3{\textdegree}-5{\textdegree} and the lateral resolution is {\textasciitilde} 35-50 cm, depending on the impact parameter of the crossing muon. The methods implemented to efficiently tag cosmogenic neutrons are also presented.},

The ionization in argon relative to the ionization produced by a comparison polonium alpha has been measured for the alpha-emitters ThX, ThC, ThA, RaC\ensuremath{'}, ThC\ensuremath{'}. For alpha-particles in this energy region from 5 to 9 Mev, no deviation of $W$ from the average $W$ for the polonium alpha could be found amounting to as much as \textonehalf{} percent. This is in marked contrast to the alpha-ionization in air from the work of Stetter. More indirect measurements in the region 1-5 Mev indicate no measurable change in $W$ for alpha-particles in argon, while values derived from the Stetter curve for air show a marked increase of $W$ as zero alpha-energy is approached. Evidence from direct measurements is given to show that the energy to make an ion pair in argon for the ${\mathrm{Li}}^{7*}$ ion emitted from the reaction ${\mathrm{B}}^{10}(n,\ensuremath{\alpha}){\mathrm{Li}}^{7*}$ is apparently the same as the average for the polonium alpha-particle.},

abstract = {We examine a simple relativistic theory of two scalar fields, first discussed by Goldstone, in which as a result of spontaneous breakdown of $U(1)$ symmetry one of the scalar bosons is massless, in conformity with the Goldstone theorem. When the symmetry group of the Lagrangian is extended from global to local $U(1)$ transformations by the introduction of coupling with a vector gauge field, the Goldstone boson becomes the longitudinal state of a massive vector boson whose transverse states are the quanta of the transverse gauge field. A perturbative treatment of the model is developed in which the major features of these phenomena are present in zero order. Transition amplitudes for decay and scattering processes are evaluated in lowest order, and it is shown that they may be obtained more directly from an equivalent Lagrangian in which the original symmetry is no longer manifest. When the system is coupled to other systems in a $U(1)$ invariant Lagrangian, the other systems display an induced symmetry breakdown, associated with a partially conserved current which interacts with itself via the massive vector boson.},

abstract = {The DarkSide-50 experiment seeks to directly detect dark matter in a liquid argon time projection chamber. In this dissertation, I present an algorithm of my design that determines the position of particle interactions with the liquid argon. This position reconstruction algorithm will be used by DarkSide-50 to reject backgrounds, particularly backgrounds from radioactive elements on the detector surface.
	The position reconstruction algorithm functions by constructing light response functions (LRFs) that map locations in the detector to the expected distribution of signal in DarkSide-50's 38 photomultiplier tubes. Accurate LRFs cannot be produced by simulations of DarkSide-50's optics because such simulations are known to be flawed. Instead, this algorithm constructs LRFs using an iterative process driven by data. Initial, flawed LRFs are produced using simulated events but then used to produce new LRFs from data events. Multiple generations of LRFs are created from data with each generation driven to better satisfy a known feature of the detector: the dominant argon-39 background is uniformly distributed.
	I also discuss a method of discriminating against surface background as an alternative to the common approach of fiducialization. This method considers the difference in goodness-of-fit between the best-fit reconstructed position and the best-fit position at the detector's surface.
	I conclude by presenting results on the performance and validity of this algorithm, including some discussion of reconstruction errors.},

We also measure the mean charge recombination fraction and its fluctuations, and we investigate the location and width of the LUX ER band.

abstract = {The theory of neutrino mixing and neutrino oscillations, as well as the properties of massive neutrinos (Dirac and Majorana), are reviewed. More specifically, the following topics are discussed in detail: (i) the possible types of neutrino mass terms; (ii) oscillations of neutrinos (iii) the implications of $\mathrm{CP}$ invariance for the mixing and oscillations of neutrinos in vacuum; (iv) possible varieties of massive neutrinos (Dirac, Majorana, pseudo-Dirac); (v) the physical differences between massive Dirac and massive Majorana neutrinos and the possibilities of distinguishing experimentally between them; (vi) the electromagnetic properties of massive neutrinos. Some of the proposed mechanisms of neutrino mass generation in gauge theories of the electroweak interaction and in grand unified theories are also discussed. The lepton number nonconserving processes $\ensuremath{\mu}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}e\ensuremath{\gamma}$ and $\ensuremath{\mu}\ensuremath{\rightarrow}3e$ in theories with massive neutrinos are considered. The basic elements of the theory of neutrinoless double-$\ensuremath{\beta}$ decay are discussed as well. Finally, the existing data on neutrino masses, oscillations of neutrinos, and neutrinoless double-$\ensuremath{\beta}$ decay are briefly reviewed. The main emphasis in the review is on the general model-independent results of the theory. Detailed derivations of these are presented.},

abstract = {We observed, for the first time, solar neutrinos in the 1.0-1.5 MeV energy range. We determined the rate of pep solar neutrino interactions in Borexino to be 3.28{\textpm}0.56(stat){\textpm} 0.26(syst) day-1(100ton)-1. Assuming the pep neutrino flux predicted by the Standard Solar Model, we obtained a constraint on the CNO solar neutrino interaction rate of <8.3 day-1(100 ton)-1 (95% C.L.). The absence of the solar neutrino signal is disfavored at 99.99997% C.L., while the absence of the pep neutrino signal is disfavored at 98% C.L. The necessary sensitivity was achieved due to the extremely low levels of radioactive contamination in Borexino and by adopting data analysis techniques for the rejection of cosmogenic 11C, the dominant background in the 1-2 MeV region. Assuming the LMA-MSW solution to solar neutrino oscillations, these values correspond to solar neutrino fluxes of (1.7{\textpm}0.3){\texttimes}108 cm-2s-1 and <7.9{\texttimes}108 cm-2s-1 (95% C.L.), respectively, in agreement with both the High and Low Metallicity Standard Solar Models. These results represent the first direct evidence of the pep neutrino signal and the strongest constraint of the CNO solar neutrino flux to date [1]. 								 [1] G. Bellini et al.

abstract = {Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) remain the most popular dark matter candidate as of 2018. DarkSide-50 is a dark matter direct detection experiment at Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. The primary mission of DarkSide-50 is to detect the nuclear recoil signals created by WIMPs scattering off Argon nuclei in a background-free operation.  								 While DarkSide-50 had demonstrated various background suppression techniques toward the background-free operation, Cherenkov radiation in coincidence with LAr scintillation remains the most severe background. In this work, I will first describe the discovery of this troublesome background in a non-blind analysis, followed by detailed background characterizations in a GEANT4-based Monte Carlo simulation. I will take you through various benchmarks of the background study, from tuning the Cherenkov related optics, to building data-driven F90 and S2 models, to exploring the analysis cuts, and finally to validating the background predictions in a recently published blind analysis. The study of Cherenkov background turns out to be crucial to establishing the background-free liquid argon technology in the field.},

The search uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3.2\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{fb}}^{\ensuremath{-}1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{TeV}$ collected in 2015 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Events are required to have at least one jet with a transverse momentum above 250 GeV and no leptons. Several signal regions are considered with increasing missing-transverse-momentum requirements between ${E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}{\&}gt;250\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$ and ${E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}{\&}gt;700\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$. Good agreement is observed between the number of events in data and Standard Model predictions. The results are translated into exclusion limits in models with large extra spatial dimensions, pair production of weakly interacting dark-matter candidates, and the production of supersymmetric particles in several compressed scenarios.},

The liquid scintillator must be shielded from the Stainless Steel Sphere and from the PMTs by a thick barrier of buffer fluid. The fluid barrier, in addition, needs to be segmented in order to contain migration of radon and daughters emanated by the Stainless Steel Sphere and by the PMTs. These requirements were met by designing and building two spherical vessel made of thin nylon film. The inner vessel contains the scintillator, separating it from the surrounding buffer.

abstract = {One of the most enduring questions in modern physics is the dark matter problem.  Measurements of galactic rotation curves taken in the middle of the twentieth century suggest that there are large spherical halos of unseen matter permeating and surrounding most galaxies, stretching far beyond their visible extents.  Although some of this mass discrepancy can be attributed to sources like primordial black holes or Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs), these theories can only explain a small percentage of this {\textquotedblleft}missing matter{\textquotedblright}.
	One approach which could account for the entirety of this missing mass is the theory of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or {\textquotedblleft}WIMPs{\textquotedblright}.  As their name suggests, WIMPs interact only through the weak nuclear force and gravity and are quite massive (100 GeV/c2 to 1 TeV/c2).  These particles have very small cross sections ($\approx$10-39 cm2) with nucleons and therefore interact only very rarely with {\textquotedblleft}normal{\textquotedblright} baryonic matter.
	To directly detect a dark matter particle, one needs to overcome this small cross-section barrier.  In many experiments, this is achieved by utilizing detectors filled with liquid noble elements, which have excellent particle identification capabilities and are very low-background, allowing potential WIMP signals to be more easily distinguished from detector noise.  These experiments also often apply uniform electric fields across their liquid volumes, turning the apparatus into Time Projection Chambers or {\textquotedblleft}TPCs{\textquotedblright}.  TPCs can accurately determine the location of an interaction in the liquid volume (often simply called an {\textquotedblleft}event{\textquotedblright}) along the direction of the electric field.
	In DarkSide-50 ({\textquotedblleft}DS-50{\textquotedblright} for short), the electric field is aligned antiparallel to the z-axis of the detector, and so the depth of an event can be determined to a considerable degree of accuracy by measuring the time between the first and second scintillation signals ({\textquotedblleft}S1{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}S2{\textquotedblright}), which are generated at the interaction point itself and in a small gas pocket above the liquid region, respectively.  One of the lingering challenges in this experiment, however, is the determination of an event{\textquoteright}s position along the other two spatial dimensions, that is, its transverse or {\textquotedblleft}xy{\textquotedblright} position.
	Some liquid noble element TPCs have achieved remarkably accurate event position reconstructions, typically using the relative amounts of S2 light collected by Photo-Multiplier Tubes ({\textquotedblleft}PMTs{\textquotedblright}) as the input data to their reconstruction algorithms.  This approach has been particularly challenging in DarkSide-50, partly due to unexpected asymmetries in the detector, and partly due to the design of the detector itself.
	A variety of xy-Reconstruction methods ({\textquotedblleft}xy methods{\textquotedblright} for short) have come and gone in DS-50, with only a few of them providing useful results.  The xy method described in this dissertation is a two-step Principal Component Analysis / Multi-Dimensional Fit (PCAMDF) reconstruction.  In a nutshell, this method develops a functional mapping from the 19-dimensional space of the signal received by the PMTs at the {\textquotedblleft}top{\textquotedblright} (or the {\textquotedblleft}anode{\textquotedblright} end) of the DarkSide-50 TPC to each of the transverse coordinates, x and y.  PCAMDF is a low-level {\textquotedblleft}machine learning{\textquotedblright} algorithm, and as such, needs to be {\textquotedblleft}trained{\textquotedblright} with a sample of representative events; in this case, these are provided by the DarkSide geant4-based Monte Carlo, g4ds.
	In this work, a thorough description of the PCAMDF xy-Reconstruction method is provided along with an analysis of its performance on MC events and data.  The method is applied to several classes of data events, including coincident de- cays, external gamma rays from calibration sources, and both atmospheric argon {\textquotedblleft}AAr{\textquotedblright} and underground argon {\textquotedblleft}UAr{\textquotedblright}.  Discrepancies between the MC and data are explored, and fiducial volume cuts are calculated.  Finally, a novel method is proposed for finding the accuracy of the PCAMDF reconstruction on data by using the asymmetry of the S2 light collected on the anode and cathode PMT arrays as a function of xy.},

In this second phase of the LHC physics program, the accelerator will provide to CMS an additional integrated luminosity of about 2500 fb-1 over 10 years of operation, starting in 2025. This will substantially enlarge the mass reach in the search for new particles and will also greatly extend the potential to study the properties of the Higgs boson discovered at the LHC in 2012. In order to meet the experimental challenges of unprecedented p-p luminosity, the CMS collaboration will need to address the aging of the present detector and to improve the ability of the apparatus to isolate and precisely measure the products of the most interesting collisions. This document describes the conceptual designs and the expected performance of the upgrades, along with the plans to develop the appropriate experimental techniques. The infrastructure upgrades and the logistics of the installation in the experimental area are also discussed. Finally, the initial cost estimates of the upgrades are presented.},

abstract = {We introduce a simulation framework for the transport of high and low energy electrons in xenon-based gaseous optical time projection chambers (OTPCs). The simulation relies on elementary cross sections (electron-atom and electron-molecule) and incorporates, in order to compute the gas scintillation, the reaction/quenching rates (atom-atom and atom-molecule) of the first 41 excited states of xenon and the relevant associated excimers, together with their radiative cascade. The results compare positively with observations made in pure xenon and its mixtures with CO2 and CF4 in a range of pressures from 0.1 to 10{\textasciitilde}bar. This work sheds some light on the elementary processes responsible for the primary and secondary xenon-scintillation mechanisms in the presence of additives, that are of interest to the OTPC technology.},

A description of the selected leading experiments is given and the strongest recent results are compared in terms of achieved background indexes (BI) and limits on effective Majorana mass. A combined limit is also shown. The second part of the review covers next generation experiments, highlighting the challenges and new technologies that may be necessary to achieve a justifiable discovery potential. A potential synergy with direct dark matter searches, which could be an especially prudent strategy in case the axial vector coupling constant is quenched in 0$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$ decay, is emphasized.},

Based on this scintillation peak, we observe 6.0 photoelectrons/keV in liquid argon with a resolution of $8.2%$ ($\ensuremath{\sigma}/E$) and $3.0$ photoelectrons/keV in liquid neon with a resolution of $19%$ ($\ensuremath{\sigma}/E$). The observed peak intensity subsequently decays with the $^{83}\mathrm{Kr}$${}^{m}$ half-life after stopping the fill, and we find evidence that the spatial location of $^{83}\mathrm{Kr}$${}^{m}$ atoms in the chamber can be resolved. $^{83}\mathrm{Kr}$${}^{m}$ will be a useful calibration source for liquid argon, neon dark matter, and solar neutrino detectors.},

abstract = {A statistical theory is presented to explain microplasma instability at the onset of avalanche in reversebiased silicon linearly graded and step junctions. An expression is derived which relates the turnoff probability of the microplasma to the differential resistance of the diode in its conducting state and to other physically measurable diode parameters. Measurements of the turnoff probability as a function of the pulse current are presented for several diodes and are shown to agree well with the derived theory. To explain the turnon probability, three expressions, each involving slightly different approximations, are derived for the probability that a carrier entering the breakdown region will initiate an avalanche. In each case, this probability is found to be proportional to the excess of the applied voltage over a uniquely definable sustaining voltage Vs , in poor agreement with experiment. The various mechanisms which determine the diode{\&}apos;s differential impedance in the conducting state are discussed and approximate expressions for the contributions of each mechanism to the differential impedance are derived. Multilevel pulses, previously interpreted as indicating more than one conducting state for a microplasma, are explained in terms of parallel breakdowns of more than one microplasma.},

abstract = {We have experimentally determined the production rate of 39Ar and 37Ar due to cosmic ray neutron interactions in argon at sea level. Understanding these production rates is important for argon-based dark matter experiments that plan to utilize argon extracted from deep underground because it is imperative to know what the ingrowth of 39Ar will be during the production, transport, and storage of the underground argon. These measurements also allow for the prediction of 39Ar and 37Ar concentrations in the atmosphere which can be used to determine the presence of other sources of these isotopes. Through controlled irradiation with a neutron beam that mimics the cosmic ray neutron spectrum, followed by direct counting of 39Ar and 37Ar decays with sensitive ultra-low background proportional counters, we determined that the production rate from cosmic ray neutrons at sea-level is expected to be (759  122) atoms/kg/day for 39Ar, and (51.0  7.0) atoms/kg/day for 37Ar. We also performed a survey of the alternate production mechanisms based on the state-of-knowledge of the associated cross-sections to obtain a total sea-level cosmic ray production rate of (1048  126) atoms/kg/day for 39Ar, (56.8  7.1) atoms/kg/day for 37Ar in underground argon, and (92  13) atoms/kg/day for 37Ar in atmospheric argon.},

abstract = {After important upgrades to the experiment, the Super-Kamiokande collaboration returns to measuring the solar mixing angle and the mass splitting $\mathrm{\ensuremath{\Delta}}\phantom{\rule{0}{0ex}}{m}_{12}^{2}$. By focusing on low-energy ${}^{8}B$ neutrinos, the collaboration is able to single out neutrinos that undergo flavor conversion only through vacuum oscillations. The results are the currently most precise values for the mixing and mass-difference parameters relevant for vacuum solar neutrino oscillations.},

abstract = {DEAP-3600 is a single-phase liquid argon (LAr) direct-detection dark matter experiment, operating 2 km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada). The detector consists of 3279 kg of LAr contained in a spherical acrylic vessel. This paper reports on the analysis of a 758 tonne day exposure taken over a period of 231 live-days during the first year of operation. No candidate signal events are observed in the WIMP-search region of interest, which results in the leading limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section on a LAr target of 3.910-45 cm2 (1.510-44 cm2) for a 100 GeV/c2 (1 TeV/c2) WIMP mass at 90% C. L. In addition to a detailed background model, this analysis demonstrates the best pulse-shape discrimination in LAr at threshold, employs a Bayesian photoelectron-counting technique to improve the energy resolution and discrimination efficiency, and utilizes two position reconstruction algorithms based on PMT charge and photon arrival times.},

abstract = {Abstract Blue-green algae (BGA) are among the most primitive life forms on earth and have been consumed as food or medicine by humans for centuries. BGA contain various bioactive components, such as phycocyanin, carotenoids, $\gamma$-linolenic acid, fibers, and plant sterols, which can promote optimal health in humans. Studies have demonstrated that several BGA species or their active components have plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride-lowering properties due to their modulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption and hepatic lipogenic gene expression. BGA can also reduce inflammation by inhibiting the nuclear factor $\kappa$ B activity, consequently reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, BGA inhibit lipid peroxidation and have free radical scavenging activity, which can be beneficial for the protection against oxidative stress. The aforementioned effects of BGA can contribute to the prevention of metabolic and inflammatory diseases. This review provides an overview of the current kno...},
