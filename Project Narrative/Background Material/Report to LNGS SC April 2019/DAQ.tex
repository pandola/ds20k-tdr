The DAQ and Trigger design for \DSk\ has been consolidating taking
care also of the advancement on the design of the VETO detector. The
main novel electronic device around which the readout architecture is built,
a new fast ADC developed for advanced digital signal processing, is close
to completion. Few prototypes from the CAEN company, Viareggio, Italy,  will be available for testing
in summer while work in close cooperation between Darkside and CAEN firmware
experts is ongoing to implement the needed DSP algorithms.
In parallel, a DAQ system for the first phase of \DSp\ run is
to be deployed in the next weeks at CERN to be able to acquire data
from the first test of the small systems equipped with up to two motherboards
and 50 channels.
