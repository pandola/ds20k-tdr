\section{Calibrations}
\label{sec:Calib}


While the goals of calibration of \DSk\ has not changed, the actual implementation is being revisited due to the changes in the TPC design as well in the veto design that calibration interfaces to. In addition to radioactive sources used in \DSf, the collaboration has been investigating alternative ways of injecting low energy neutrons for low energy nuclear recoil calibration. Recently investigated method that will also be utilized in the DUNE experiment is utilization of the 57\,keV neutron scattering resonance in argon, that makes argon nearly transparent to 57\,keV neutrons. This feature will allow injection of neutrons deep into the veto, close to TPC for the TPC nuclear recoil calibration with low energy neutrons. 57\,keV neutrons are produced via moderation of 2.45\'MeV neutrons from the DD generator. %DSf\ is possession of the DD gun procured by Temple group. \\
In parallel, plans are being developed for the calibration needs of the \DSk\ prototype detectors for x-y positioning, light yield and nuclear recoil calibration.
