\section{Planning for Safety and Authorization Documents}
\label{sec:Safety}

Following interactions with \LNGS, the \DSs\ Collaboration is in charge to specify all the requirements in term of safety, and provide them to the \LNGS\ Services for the final and complete risk evaluation, which will include a series of studies like:
\begin{compactitem}
\item A new PRA, with extension of the scope such as to cover the complete set of \DSk\ sub-plants;
\item Quantitative risk analysis (QRA) of the entire set of \DSk\ sub-plants;
\item ``Relazione di Non Aggravio di Rischio'', as mandated by ``Seveso-Ter EC Directive'', received by Italian D.~Lgs. 105/15;
\item Explosion risk assessment (ERA);
\item Reliability system assessment (RSA).
\end{compactitem}

The risk assessment process was put into stand-by due to the re-design of the veto.  All these steps, as well as any other future steps that may become necessary for completion of all safety reviews, authorizations, and associated preparation of documents, will be tightly coordinated with the \LNGS\ Directorate.
