\section{Supplementary Documents}
The first of the ``Supplementary Documents'' attached to this proposal is the ``Project Execution Plan'' requested in the solicitation.

A ``Preliminary Design Report'' was prepared in~2016 and later published as \refref{Aalseth:2018gq}.  However, following the approval of the experiment in~2017, \LNGS\ requested that the \GADMC\ reconsider its original approved plan, an organic liquid scintillator veto detector nested inside a water Cherenkov veto detector, in order to minimize any possible environmental impacts of underground \LNGS\ operations.  Following this recommendation, the \GADMC\ abandoned its original plan and developed a new solution based on the \pDUNE\ membrane cryostats developed at \CERN.  The \LArTPC\ of \DSks\ is placed at the center of the \pDUNE\ cryostat, which will be filled with \pDUNELArMass\ of liquefied \AAr. Part of this volume will be instrumented and serve as a scintillation (and Cherenkov) anti-coincidence veto detector.  The new design basis is captured in an ``Intermediate Design Report'', also appended as a Supplementary Document.  A detailed ``Technical Design Report'' is in preparation and its completion is expected by the spring of~2020.

Other Supplementary Documents include a letter from the \INFN\ President F.~Ferroni, detailing \INFN's approval and \LNGS's commitment to host the experiment; a letter from the Vice President for Source \& Transportation of the Kinder Morgan CO2 Company K.~Havens, approving the \Urania\ specifications and detailing their commitment to hosting the \Urania\ facility; an excerpt from the authorization for the installation and commissioning of \SeruciOne\ (and its translation into English); and the most significant quotations provided in support of the Basis of Estimate.
