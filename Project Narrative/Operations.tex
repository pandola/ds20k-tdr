\section{Operations and Utilization Plan}

%{For Implementation projects, discuss the overall plan for operating the infrastructure, including as a minimum management/governance plans, strategy for access and utilization of the infrastructure by the target research communities, and planned metrics and evaluation of the success and impact of the NSF investment in this infrastructure. This section must also identify the anticipated sources of operations and maintenance funding, including any needs for ongoing, NSF-supported operations and maintenance (O&M) that may be requested outside of the Mid-scale RI-1program.}

The organizations proposing this work, including the sub-award recipients, are all part of two existing collaborative NSF awards that have Princeton as the lead-institution.  Princeton's awards are PHY-1812540 and PHY-1622415, with all associated collaborative awards falling within the same purpose.  These grants run through 2022 and 2023, respectively, and therefore cover any operations and maintenance costs that fall outside of the scope of this Mid-scale RI-1 Program request but within the same time period.  The first award provides personnel support and operations costs for \DSk\ detector and the second provides some initial capital construction costs for \DSk\ project.  The proposers hope that the level of support provided to the groups with the collaborative awards will be extended beyond the 2022 end date in order to ensure successful operation of the \DSk\ experiment for the entirety of the planned runtime.
