\section{Foreign Collaborator Contribution}
\label{sec:foreigncollaborators}

The DarkSide program has been characterized by a strong international contribution since its inception, most notably with the siting of \DSfs\ at the Gran Sasso National laboratory in Italy and the significant participation and funding contribution from the INFN. The increasing role of INFN in DarkSide activities led to the submission of a joint \DSks\ proposal to INFN and the NSF. In addition to the strong collaboration with Italy, early \DS\ collaborators included groups from China, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, and eventually expanded to groups from France, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Mexico, Germany, Romania, Spain, Switzerland,  and the UK. This expansion coincided with the formation of the \GADMC\, during which DarkSide joined forces with the miniCLEAN program at SNOLAB, Canada, and the ArDM program at Canfranc, Spain. The GADMC as it exists today was cemented with the merging of the DEAP program in 2017, with the participation of three national underground laboratories (Gran Sasso, SNOLAB, and Canfranc), and a partnership with the LAr neutrino program at CERN. The current DarkSide-20k collaboration counts 374 scientists and engineers from 77 institutions and laboratories from 16 countries as members. The responsibilities of foreign institutions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Italy (INFN)}: \DSks\ (laboratory logistics, argon veto, PDMs, DAQ, computing, mechanical integration, simulations, material screening), ReD, Aria, Urania (plant design and delivery), and DART
\item{Italy (Regione Sardegna)}: Aria
\item{Italy (Regione Abruzzo and Italian Government)}: Nuova Officina Assergi (NOA)
\item{Canada}: DarkSide-20k (acrylic vessel, TPB coating, conductive film development, electronics and DAQ) and Urania (underground argon transportation and storage)
\item{Poland}: DarkSide-20k (material screening and radon control)
\item{Spain}: DarkSide-20k (TPC fabrication, material screening) and DART
\item{France}: DarkSide-20k (simulations, veto), ARIS, and ReD
\item{Russia}: DarkSide-20k ( background simulations, veto development, ultra low radioactive  material development and screening, calibration systems development, development of machine learning algorithms for particle identifications, monte-carlo and offline software )
\item{China}: DarkSide-20k (acrylic procurement)
\end{itemize}
